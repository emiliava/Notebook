Bosch Headlight Bulb,Auto,0,4.0,United Kingdom,2020-04-17,"Bought these after buying so called brighter light bulbs for my V70. What you don't realise is that when you buy brighter bulbs the life is much shorter. As my car runs with dipped beam all the time, the benefit of the brighter bulb is only of any use in winter when its dark, so went for the Bosch ones. They are actually brother than the Philips ones that were on the car. At the price you cannot complain. If you have poor lights, more likely to be poor reflector lenses, so don't get fooled unless you drive at night all the time. 2 bulbs for half the price of one premium?? Will see how long they last but very little difference in light output, worth thinking about.",6

Amazon Basics Microfibre Cleaning Cloths Pack of X,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-06-14,"I often pick up Amazon branded products for household and DIY jobs, the quality is normally reliable and value is comparable if not better than high street competitors. Dishcloths and Microfibre cloths seem to be missing the washing machine in my house at the moment and heading straight for the bin so i picked up a 12 pack a week ago.

The Good

* I am a fan of three colours, one colour is a little boring, more than five or six colours then your Kitchen and your drawers can look like old deckchairs. Three colours is just enough variety!

* First impressions of Softness are good, ive used a couple to help wash the car, no issues with scratches, i did run them through cold water first to make sure they didnt leave bits on the car paintwork.

* Absorbency around the kitchen is very good, spills and wiping worktops they do a fine job. I am certainly not looking for kitchen towel or an additional cloth to finish jobs.

* Half of the pack of 12 or so have now been through a machine wash - i know people do say hand wash, i just dont have the patience and at this price point am ok if they do get a little thread worn in the washing machine. However thus far they have been through a cycle and come out just fine, ready for the next job.

The Could be better

* A minor point to note but i did expect them to be a little thicker, that said they still offer decent softness and absorbency so not a big issue.

A good sized pack at a decent price point, absorbency is good, softness too, they wash out great and the colours are a pleasant respite from having a bottom drawer that looks like it could be a Pyjama drawer!

Lanpad 2 Pack Faraday Pouch for car keys,Auto,0,1.0,United Kingdom,2020-02-14,"It worked to start with but didn't last long, I started being able to open the car sometimes with the key still in the faraday bag. Now I can open it and start it all the time with the key in the bag. I only have the one key inside and no metal to damage the material and there is no visible damage but it hasn't lasted. I started using the spare bag which again worked to begin with but after 2 weeks that one is now letting me open and start the car without getting the key out of the bag.

Now they are completely useless, he may as well just carry the key in his pocket. Obviously they are of very poor quality for the lining to have failed already.

Autoglym,Auto,0,1.0,United Kingdom,2020-05-01,"Price paid: £12
Delivery: Prime, guaranteed by the end of the week. Arrived early.

What can I say. My first experience with 'snow foam' is a total let down. This stuff is simply a marketing ploy to get people to take photos of their car while it's covered in white foam to slap on social media and tag Autoglym. Let's do the usual and break it down into pros and cons.

Pros:
+ Really easy to use. Picked up a bottle for my pressure washer lance a few weeks ago and decided to give the foam a try. Simply use a funnel if you have one and fill the bottle up. I used 2 parts water to 1 part foam
+ Plug and play. As soon as your bottle is filled, start spraying. Probably dependant on your lance bottle size, mine is approx 300-400ml and probably lasted about 3/4 mins of having the trigger pulled down
+ Saves time covering car with soap manually. Read cons for more details
+ Even during the pandemic, this came earlier than expected. Ordered on a Monday, said by Friday, but came on Wednesday.

Cons:
- The power of the foam. Don't expect this to make the dirt just fall off the car, it doesn't. I tried this on a small to medium car covered in light to moderate dirt/dust. Being my first snow foam attempted I decided to see what all the fuss about with people claiming the dirt to just run off. I did 2x runs.

First run was covering the car with foam and leaving it for a few minutes until the 'snow' has disappeared. I then pressure washed the remainder off and the results were pretty bad once the car dried. I have attached the photos of this first run so you can see for yourself.

The second run was better, however this time I covered the car with foam, then I allowed it soak for a few minutes then just attacked the car with a clean wash mitt. In all honesty, no better than regular car shampoo and wax combo. Might as well have continued using the two bucket of water and soap method - I guess it did save time covering the car with soap, but when you can pick up some Turtle Wax shampoo and wax for well less than half this stuff it's a no brainer.

Expected this to be a decent buy for colder months to speed up the process of car cleaning and detailing when you don't want to get your hands cold and be outside for a long period of time. Boy was I wrong. Stay away from this marketing ploy!",59
AA 12V Digital Tyre Inflator AA5502 – For Cars Other Vehicles Inflatables Bicycles - Shows PSI BAR KPA 0-120 PSI – Includes Adaptors,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-01-22,I've went through a few 12V Digital Tyre Inflators in the past and although it's early days this is so much better. The screw on hose to connect to the tyre is so much easier than the clip on type that never stay on or if they do aren't on far enough to depress the valve. The digital readout removes any guesswork about tyre pressures and is far more convincing than the analogue dial which rarely remain accurate. All in all a handy addition for folks with alloy wheels who need to top up their tyres with irritating regularity.,9

I like the finish the carbon fibre against the red stitching is modern and good looking. My Audi keys fit perfectly, one in each pouch. I found a small chain and key ring in the pouch. This is not necessary in my view unless it is a quick release as I wouldn’t want the pouch dangling from the key but a nice touch for anyone that has a use for it? There has been a recent spate of car thefts in our area where scanners have been used.

Autoglym,Auto,0,2.0,United Kingdom,2020-07-07,"Polar WashI take car cleaning seriously, I snow foam and rinse, I have buckets with grit guards etc etc, i always wanted a shampoo product that i could spray onto the car after i have used the snow foam first  and just run around with a couple of wash mitts once the car is covered in shampoo.  I thought this was it ! however it doesn't foam and cling enough for me ( i would not expect it to foam as thickly as a snow foam). You spray the car and by the time you get around it most of it has gone, i have been increasing the concentration and i think when I reach a good enough mix it will be too expensive to use. ( i might try standard shampoos in my snow foam gun to see how that compares, maybe with a drop of snow foam to increase the foam levels).Snow foam generally does not have the same ingredients as a shampoo, so it does not condition the paint, shampoo feesl more slick/slippery when you use it with a wash mitt so the mitt glides over much nicer, it also does not leave a surface that easier to rinse or leave in some cases a shiny surface, snow foam is a cleaner that your rinse off, not wash the car with, thats not its job.Snow foam get sprayed on the car first, Auto Glym  version of a snow foam is POLAR BLAST. You let Snow foam dwell and then rinse off. You do not use this to wash the car with mitts etc. when you rinse this off a good snow foam product takes a lot of the grime with it. this means when you wash the car there is less chance of surface contaminants scratching the paint work. this is when you then use shampoo or polar wash  and wash by hand.nice idea and has prompted me to try some of my own combinations,",6
Autoglym,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-06-04,"I've always used Autoglym products, since getting a new pressure washer with the bottle attachments, this is all I use now. I've bought into the full set of Polar Blast, Polar Wash, Polar Seal. It makes cleaning the cars so much easier and they do a really great job.

This pre-wash foam is great for softening up bird poo, dried on muck, spattered insects etc.

My only complaint is that it mixes 50:50 with water, where as the Polar Wash mixes 1:5, so you need 5 times as many bottles of these as the Polar Wash. I wish they had concentrated it more so that it lasted longer.

If you haven't used these before, do yourself a favour, buy 3 bottle attachments for your pressure washer, and use the whole set. Super shiny cars with much less effort.",5

Pressing plus to set pressure there is no response then suddenly jumps way past pressure you want to set. Reducing button works but then pressing the go button sometimes it doesn't work and pressure read out won't go above 30 psi. It's very unreliable. I intend to test it one more time then it'll likely be going back unless it starts working. Not sure I have confidence in it,5
Bosch Headlight Bulb,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2019-12-03,"Good bulbs. As with all these bulbs that claim amazing extra brightness, take with a pinch of salt. Bought these because I was going to have my headlights out on my car and it’s a lights out to change a bulb (really stupid design) so decided to change the bulbs while they were out as I didn’t know when the were last done. I’d say they give you about 10% extra light over the cheap bulbs that were in before and very slightly whiter light but by no means white light. If you buy the super bright bulbs they just burn out with in 12 months so in my opinion not worth it. Overall, good price for slight upgrade over cheap bulbs.",0

Lanpad 2 Pack Faraday Pouch for car keys,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-02-02,"I just bought a keyless entry car and didn't quite know how this whole keyless thing would pan out. Do I get a puch or a box, is it a faff and so on.
I decided on the pouches as you get two, one for your spare and one for your main key. I found the best way to do it was keep the car key separate from the rest of the keys and just pop it out of the pouch and put it in your pocket when going out.
The pouch would probably take 4 or 5 keys but the single key is by far the easiest method. I have stood next to car with the key in the pouch and the car would not unlock, so it works.
The pouch itself looks neat and has a snap hook on the back and a small chain on the inside to attach your key. I don't use either and will probably remove both at some point.
I'm very happy with this new method to take on and it works well. Just separate your car key and square it in a (zippable?) pocket because, let's face it you don't need it, and keep the keys you do use (house etc) in another pocket.",1

Autoglym,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-02-14,"I thought I’d step up my car wash routine from the usual bucket and sponge to full on pressure washer with foams and rinse. After a bit of research the Autoglym products appeared to get good reviews which seem to be justified.

Following the Autoglym instructions of rinse, Polar Blast soak for 10 minutes, rinse, Polar Wash, *sponge*, rinse, Polar Seal, rinse and then dry I was fairly impressed, however, there’s no getting round it... you will still need to use a sponge as a pressure washer alone will not remove all the dirt.

Fortunately the Polar Wash foam is soapy so the addition of a bucket of warm water, shampoo and a noodle mitt at this point makes the car wash quick and easy.

Polar Blast, as mentioned by others, seems pointless but I believe it helps to dissolve the dirt a little before you move onto the wash stage.

Polar Seal is awesome and causes the water to bead and run off leaving a super shiny finish that’s easy to clean next time around.

What has surprised me the most is how far it goes. All of the products are diluted into warm water and I’m using 250ml or less of the diluted solutions. I initially bought one snow foam gun but after a successful first few washes bought two more so I can keep the part used solutions under the sink between washes.

Recommended if you want to take your car wash to the next level.",1
Autoglym,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-04-22,"After reading reviews on different car shampoo's decided to go for AG.
It has to be used with a snow foam cannon/bottle but boy does it foam.
Only slight issue is it can be too foamy and is a pain to get out of shuts and gaps otherwise its a pain and takes longer to get rid of it...
As for cleaning power i had a car that hadn't been washed in about four months so a lot of dirt and traffic film build up and was ok but i think it could have broke down dirt more, maybe need to let it dwell a bit longer but the sun was out and didn't have time before it drys out then your left with dreaded water marks stains to get out double the work.
I would say this is better for when cleaning you car say weekly as it will make it quicker and easier as i said my car was filthy and if it weren't so dirty probably would have done a better job but never the less does what it should.",4
Autoglym,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2019-12-05,Surprised to see this set with a single 1 star review! The products are excellent (see individual product reviews) and this starter set allows you to try before you buy the much bigger bottles. The set gives you quite a few washes (I halved the quantities for my MINI) and I can’t fault them. I recommend two clean buckets of water with grit guards to wash your mitt out during the polar wash stage. The final stage leaves a really good shine and you just spray it onto a wet car and then dry as normal. Great protection including your alloys which I can never be bothered to wax.,4

- power lead only long enough to do one side of the car at a time
- setting the target pressure not as intuitive / responsive as it could be

Autoglym,Auto,0,4.0,United Kingdom,2020-03-05,"This is a nice easy to use Autoglym product, creating massive amount of foam that dwells for a very respectable time.

This type of product is typically used as the first part of multi stage cleaning process, followed by a hand wash and then some type of sealant or wax at the end (in Autoglym's case this is Polar Wash and then Polar Seal in this product line). The purpose is to remove as much solid dirt as possible to avoid scratching paintwork during the hand wash process, and this is where the product falls down a bit.

It does clean to a degree, and the dwell time of the product on the paintwork helps in that respect, though when pressure washing it off there can still be a fair amount of grime left. An equivalent product from Bilt Hamber (Autofoam) removes significantly more dirt and grime for a similar cost.

Another aspect is that the surplus foam from this product can stick around for some time - when I've used it in winter is has managed to remain on the road for around 3 days!

Ultimately, this is probably more a 3-season product that is less able to deal with typical UK winter road dirt, though is still a good product that probably suits vehicles that are not left to get too dirty...",2
Autoglym,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-04-23,"40ml of product to around 200ml of water for a car means it ‘should’ last 25 uses.

Autoglym,Auto,0,4.0,United Kingdom,2020-06-29,"This is a really nice and satisfying product.  I use this with a Karcher jet wash (K2) and foam nozzle.  I'm not sure if the results are any better than using a bucket and sponge with Autoglym standard shampoo, but the results aren't any worse.  If anything, the product possibly reduces the likeness of picking up any further contaminants from the bucket.  Using this foam shampoo is incredibly satisfying however and I'll continue to use this regardless of my previous point as a small amount of this product goes a very long way.I found combining this with Autoglym 'super resin' polish and the gold label 'extra gloss' gives awesome results.  Our Audi A3 which has 110,000 miles on looks almost as good as new.  Providing water is wiped off with a micro-fibre cloth the results are incredible.",1
Autoglym,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-05-06,"I have used a Karcher foam cannon and used 100ml of Polar Blast in contrast to 400ml of water. Which would equal for about 25 washes of the car which is great in my opinion for this price.

The foam is thick, not too thick so that it doesn't slide down for example on the bonnet, but just amount of tick to slide down and get all the dirt down before touch washing.

This is the first type of product of this kind so I can't compare to other brands but in works exceptional in my opinion.

I have Karcher K3 and Karcher foam cannon and it works a treat.

Highly recommended.",1
AA 12V Digital Tyre Inflator AA5502 – For Cars Other Vehicles Inflatables Bicycles - Shows PSI BAR KPA 0-120 PSI – Includes Adaptors,Auto,0,1.0,United Kingdom,2020-05-18,Unfortunately this mini-compressor failed to operate for maybe 3 out of 4 times that the button was pressed. Most of the time it simply made a strangled clunking sound (like a valve opening) and did nothing. I obviously got a dud one so this has been returned for a refund. It also has a fairly big design flaw in that it uses a screw-on valve connector rather than a lever-activated one. The net result is that you lose about 2-3 PSI screwing the thing on and then another 2-3 PSI taking it off again. You therefore have to add 2-3 PSI to the value you are inflating to in the knowledge  that you're going to lose that when you disconnect!,3
Lanpad 2 Pack Faraday Pouch for car keys,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-02-07,"It seems to work as it is supposed to. I’ve tried to open the car with the key still in the pouch, but it won’t have it.

I could open my car and start the engine without even removing the key from the pouch.I have to admit that the main reason I chose this one over the many others on Amazon is the fact that this one has the ring and chain attached. My key is permanently attached to the pouch and gets tucked away inside once the car is locked. At night, I keep the pouch inside a Faraday Box, so it is doubly protected. That car cost me a lot of money, so I’m looking after it the best I can.I cannot comment on how robust this pouch is yet, because I’ve only been using it for a few weeks, but it looks pretty well constructed, so fingers crossed.You won’t get a whole bunch of keys inside this pouch, just your car key, but there is an external carabiner style clip on which to attach your other keys.

It would also have been useful if it had a loop to be able to fit on to a belt. As for the question of durability, I have only had it a week but it seems well made. As for the service from the seller, it was very good. I ordered it on a Saturday afternoon & received it by Tuesday morning.",1

Autoglym,Auto,0,1.0,United Kingdom,2020-04-14,"It does foam, smells good and is easy to apply with a pressure washer, but this is where the positives end.After using on a well polished car that only had light dirt/dust covering due to little use recently i expected the shine to return easily. This product after being washing off left a dull coating on a shiny surface leaving it looking worse than i had started. To get over the problem i had to use a sponger and bucket and then apply an Autoglym sealer really disappointed Autoglym are selling this product.",3
Autoglym,Auto,0,2.0,United Kingdom,2020-06-30,"Well i had high hopes  for this product.Unfortunatley packaging doesn't mention the fact you need a jet wash which can be used on a lower pressure.I followed instructions for dilution and attached mixing bottle.As it hit the car it looked foamy , then after a few seconds just ran off .Tried 4 different solutions and watched you tube videos, but no luck just the same.May as well just hand wash car, as you have to wipe with a mitt anyway.Finish is no better than ordinary autoglym shampoo.I certainly would not buy a new adjustable pressure jet wash and an auto glym foam bottle for it to work.Save your money unless you have the correct jet wash.I get a better finish when I hand wash, and its quicker.More like auto glum to me",0
Autoglym,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-04-13,Been a weekend car washer with slight OCD lol I've tried several snow foam products and settled with this 1 yes it's pricey you can buy cheaper products but will they do the same job ? This produces a nice long lasting foam that dwells and stays I just do the normal rinse my car with pressure washer first to get rid of loose dirt then apply the foam leave for 8 to 10 mins wash of then use Auto Glym high definition shampoo another great product and do a 2 bucket wash with a good quality wash mitt then i tried the new Turtle Wax Hybrid Sealant Hydrophobic coating spray and wow that's another amazing product left my car with a shine like glass so to sum it up if you want great results all the time you'll have to pay a little more you get what you pay for would reccomend give it a go try all 3 products you'll be glad you did,0

Each tyre I tried to use it on ended up at a much lower pressure than they had started out on, and was no where near the pressure this pump displayed when it had finished pumping.

If you're buying this in case of emergency do no trust that it will help you, it will only mean you have no idea what pressure your tyres are at.

Bought a different pump off amazon and it worked great, it's just this product that has the problem. Don't trust it just because it says it's AA.",3

Lanpad 2 Pack Faraday Pouch for car keys,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-03-17,"Bought these as my new car has keyless entry and emitts a permanent signal which as you know can be copied and your car can be taken.

They are reasonable quality for the price and work as you'd expect.",2
Lanpad 2 Pack Faraday Pouch for car keys,Auto,0,3.0,United Kingdom,2020-02-14,Quite a good item. These as with all the others i have used only last about 4 months. Then after that they dont block the key signal. Still a better option than some scumbag cloning the keys. I like the attached chain and ring. Makes use a lot easier.

Lanpad 2 Pack Faraday Pouch for car keys,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-01-25,"Was a bit dubious as to whether they actually work well but figured they were worth a shot. The cost of the pouches was insignificant to the cost of my car. They arrive and we religiously store our keys in them but never actually tested them. Fast forward a month, I unlock the car replacing the key in the pouch and press start in the car. It tells me no key is present and the car won't start. Takes me a minute to realise the key is the pouch. So obviously it works. How long it will last is unknown as I don't know if constantly putting the key in and out will damage the material and therefore prevent it from working. However I will be testing it regularly from now on and would purchase another if/when that time comes. The small price is worth the peace of mind that it adds another level of security for my car.",0
Lanpad 2 Pack Faraday Pouch for car keys,Auto,0,4.0,United Kingdom,2020-06-08,The pouch is too big for the digital car key I have and does not fit in my trouser pocket with comfort. At the moment the key remains in the pocket. The key has to be out of the pouch to operate the car so therefore the pouch becomes another large item to store when driving. A smaller pouch with the key may be left in the pocket when driving. The quality of the pouch is very good. The practicality does not appear to have been a consideration in the design. The advert does not show dimensions of the pouch. Not happy with the purchase apart for the spare key kept at home. Perhaps future design should contain a small and large pouch for driving and storage respectively.,0

Lanpad 2 Pack Faraday Pouch for car keys,Auto,0,4.0,United Kingdom,2020-02-22,Had a spate of vehicles being taken locally especially high end cars by scum taking others people hard earned cars by using devices to scan your house for car key codes. So thought this may protect my car. These are a good size and you get 2 so make sure you also keep your spare key inside 1 of these. Difficult to tell if they are really effective without having one of the scanners yourself to test or see if your car is stolen whilst the keys are inside these pouches. Best to get a steering wheel lock as well as this seems to deter the scum from attempting to take your car as they tend to look for easier targets.

Lanpad 2 Pack Faraday Pouch for car keys,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-04-14,"Excellent product. Works well, my key fob fails to operate whilst inside of the pouch.

I've read a few reviews on here saying the stitching is of poor quality. I don't know if this is strictly true, but I could potentially see the key chain holder coming loose if you plan to attach your key and keep it attached.

However, the pouch will be staying in my house and the key will be taken in and out when I need my key. So therefore, I am not bothered about the key chain stitching.

The pouch works. That's the most important thing.

For reference, a pouch fits one fob. My fob is a new style comfort access BMW fob, and it's just enough space.

I've also read that apparently these pouches stop working.
I don't know the mechanics behind this or if the materials have a shelf life, but as long as the thing isn't abused I cannot see this being an issue.",0

Autoglym,Auto,0,2.0,United Kingdom,2020-02-16,"Yet another gimmick claiming to do a fantastic job of cleaning your car with minimal effort. There is no such thing. Yes it covers the car and soaks into the dirt to help clean it, which is fine, but no where is there any mention of the ridiculous mess that is made in doing so. When rinsing away it just sits on the drive. It does not disperse! You have to power wash the stuff off your drive towards the drain which takes an age, so all time saved in car cleaning effort is absorbed by clearing away the embarrassing mess it makes. It’s just one gigantic mess. Just do the job properly the old fashioned way. There is no substitute for effort cleaning your car. Short cuts are a gimmick that do not work. Crap product!",2

To be honest, I felt that I could have just used the pressure washer to wash off the shampoo and be left with a clean car! However I went over the car with a sponge and a bucket of water (product free) and it looked fantastic. It was drying incredible quickly by itself but a once over with a chamois got rid of any residual dampness.

When you return to the car, you take out the fob to reconnect to the car, which allows you to just pull on the driver's door handle and the door will open - no need even to press the 'Open' icon on the key fob.

There's a nice attachment to hang the bag up and there's a key ring on a chain inside the bag if you want to keep the keys with the bag when you take them out, I don't so I tucked this away inside the bag as I suspected it might act as a signal aerial if left dangling outside. 1 star off for the tightness and the pointless key ring inside.",0
Autoglym,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-07-17,Used different snow foams in the past but this one seems to clean a lot better than all the others. Very cheap price for the size. Followed the instructions and mixed 100ml of the polar blast to 500ml of hot water. Used it in my foam cannon along with a Karcher pressure washer and the foam was thick and stayed on for over 10 minutes. Got rid of most of the dirt on my car after using my wash mitt and brushes to agitate the foam. Seems like it will last me another 25 washes depending on the amount you use. Does what it is supposed to do and doesn't have a bad smell.,0
Bosch Headlight Bulb,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-03-14,Excellent bulb if you want a cheap option compared to night breakers.The dip beam mask on my projector headlights are very sharply defined and distance I can safely see is noticeable increased.,0
Lanpad 2 Pack Faraday Pouch for car keys,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-06-21,This is a first class product. I tested it by trying to start my car with te key in the  pouch. Whoops is didn't work and that was great. I also find it useful for keeping my credit card in whilst shopping so it can't be scanned which in these times is a bonus. I feel very safe now knowing that those two things are safe. If you are looking for a keyless car safety pouch look no further this is the one and an extra bonus you get 2. What's not to like.,0
Lanpad 2 Pack Faraday Pouch for car keys,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-02-09,"After more and more reports of thefts in my local area of cars that were keyless entry, I decided to have a look at what was available. I decided on this product based on the other reviews and the price. Very reasonable and they work as described. I tested both bags with both keys and they both performed as expected-nothing happened! Standing right next to my car and no signals got through with the keys in the bag. Very pleased.The only downside I can possibly think of is that if you keep your car keys with lots of other keys or key rings that you won’t be able to get them all in a bag. Basically, the remote fob and a single key ring, like a car manufacturer or garage fob, will be ok. Anymore than this and you will struggle to fold the end over and seal it.However the price of a stolen car against a reorganised car key key ring is a no brainer!Would recommend",0

The chain inside is very handy to prevent the car key being lost. I would have liked a similar style with the chain and also space to insert my house keys such as another slot or space at the back. However, very good overall.",0
Autoglym,Auto,0,2.0,United Kingdom,2020-06-21,"So here’s my view. We all know this is a gimmick, but:

Amazon Basics Microfibre Cleaning Cloths Pack of X,Auto,0,1.0,India,2020-01-06,The item is a really a big dissappointment. It is smaller than a gents hand kerchief.

(The reviews which talk about testing these things by pressing the button on the key fob are missing the point. If you need to press the button you probably don't need the pouch. It blocks signals sent by keyless entry fobs, which send a signal continuously without needing you to press buttons. You can also switch off the signal for some cars. Check youtube and google for 'deactivate keyless entry'. However, it causes problems with some cars, in which case these things are at least a fix of sorts.)",0

I do think this si VERY good value for money, as for does it do anything? I dont personally think so however it does look cool, and everyone questions it with the same old saying ""Oh i did not know it snowed today""
As it turns out i cannot appear to post a picture, maybe since i did not buy it from here. but i an ssure you it is thick if you want it to be!",0

Autoglym,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-06-22,"I bought this based on a couple of recommendations online, and it works so well in my Karcher pressure washer (with snow foam lance). I use it after I've washed with a foaming cleaner first, that I let dwell for 5 or so mins, then wash off with water. This stuff works wonders after that - just add half an inch to an inch to the bottom of the bottle, top up with water, and attach to the pressure washer. It leaves a nice deep finish on the car (after the washes)  leaving a decent seal. Just finish it off with a wax afterwards, and it's a quick way to keep on top of car cleaning!Not sure on how long a bottle will last, but at this price, it's cheap enough to do it once a week all summer!",1

2. The scent is okay, but not my cup of tea.
3. I somehow cannot determine how much is good for 10 litres of water as 2 screwtop full seems like nothing has been added to the water😂.
4. Do not let it dry on you car. Make sure your car is prewashed and use little sections and rinse quickly.
5. It has conditioner in it so gives your car a good clean and shine and the water just slides off.
6. Its pH neutral so its safe for your hands.

Autoglym Bodywork Shampoo Conditioner,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-07-13,"I have used cheaper products and they are not as good! Autoglym was recommended to be by a professional car valet and he was 100% right to do so. All products are easy to use, i watched the video which is in the gallery here and it was helpful. I am not a massive car person but i have an extremely hairy and messy dog which was building up grime in my car. I recommend having the appropriate cloth for each cycle.

The shampoo worked well at getting dirt off the vinyl and seats, well, most surfaces really. Any stubborn parts and you just add an extra spray and build up more of a foam and it goes. Wipe with a drying cloth.

Glass spray is great for windows and touch screens and stereos, mirrors, etc. Just make sure you buff it out properly, although if it does smear a little, it doesn't obscure your vision through the windows like some products do.

Vinyl spray makes everything look that bit more professional. It helps keep dust and dirt away (although my dog does like a challenge). It is great for a quick once over too.

I honestly though my car was doomed to look and smell dirty forever but now it smells nice and looks clean, something i have not experienced for about 2 years. If you haven't guessed, I totally recommend this product.",4

This is obviously my bad as firstly I forgot to put the lid back on after use, but i was also wearing headphones and didn't hear it fall over or the presumed ""glug"" sound as the bottle emptied its remaining contents, leaving a Hollywood esq toxic spill looking pool of sludge on my kitchen floor.

"Microfibre Cloths Similar to Exel Magic Cleaning Cloths. Chemical Free Cleaning. Large Super Soft Premium Fibre, Washable Cloth Duster for Car, Motorbike, Domestic Appliances, Industrial use",Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-02-02,"Blown away by how good these are. Purchased a big bundle of yellow ones to use on the car so when drying it's easy to see if I have picked up dirt that may scratch it.

Initially (and admittedly before using them) I thought they felt a bit thin and crappy or cheap and nasty like others I had previously bought, (that ended up as blankets for barbie dolls).

However, I was wrong. These absorb so much water when totally dry its unbelievable. One sweep over the roof of a freshly washed Nissan Leaf and it was near perfect. Easy to wring out and go again. To TOTALLY dry the car only took 2 of these cloths. The first to go over and get the bulk off, then a new dry one to get the last little bits to a perfect shine... and that includes all the glass, the gap at the bottom of the rear screen and under the glass of the wing mirrors!

Will be buying more of these in various colours for other household tasks.

Easy 60 degree 1hr wash with no fabric conditioner and come out like new.

These come highly recommended from me.",58

Ring RAC610 In-Car Air Compressor for Cars and Commercial Vehicles 12 V / 85 W / 100 psi / 7 bar,Auto,0,3.0,United Kingdom,2020-07-25,"To be fair this is probably an ideal emergency inflator for the average car, but it is not really up to a van.
I bought it primarily to use with the air suspension toppers on my 5.4 metre Ducato campervan. The screw on connector is difficult to use, and lots of air escapes when disconnecting. A clip-on or hold on connector would be much better. Also the power cable is too short to get to the rear wheels - but would probably be OK for most cars.

The device is lightweight, but insubstantial, and probably would not survive a few drops on to a hard surface. It does take a long time to inflate, and has a warning against running for more than 15 minutes.
I have also thought of using it on my classic sports car, but could probably top up the tyres more quickly with a foot pump.

Overall, an OK piece of kit for occasional or emergency use, but not for frequent general use.

Seems to be good value.",3

Ring RAC610 In-Car Air Compressor for Cars and Commercial Vehicles 12 V / 85 W / 100 psi / 7 bar,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-06-17,"Bearing in mind, I have only used this once, it is surprisingly impressive. The plastics aren’t particularly solid, but the simple design is really good. The hose, cable and adapters all have their own retainers within the body of the pump, making it neat to carry around, the base has rubber feet to keep it steady on the floor and the speed of this pump surprised me. I pumped up a tyre on my Honda Accord, from 12psi (yeah, I know, I think my alloy may be leaking somewhat!) to 32 psi in 4 minutes, which is very good for the size of this item. The motor is pretty noise, probably due to the fact that it’s fairly powerful. At the price, this is a steal, I’d be surprised if any other product would beat this for the price. I bought one back in 2004 and it was heavy, large and most of all, rubbish. This is a bargain, I just hope it lasts. Many petrol stations now charge 50p a throw to pump up tyres, this should save a few bob over time.",0

It takes the need of finding a place and pocket change each time you feel you should be checking air pressure (which you should do every month). Alot of people will not bother doing it every month as it's one of them chores that we just keep pushing back. This has been really helpful to pump air back to standard pressures for 5 years now, still working so it may last another 5. Who knows, but in my books, it has served it's purpose 10 times over and thus if it fails in the next minute, I will request a state funeral for it.",0

Ring RAC610 In-Car Air Compressor for Cars and Commercial Vehicles 12 V / 85 W / 100 psi / 7 bar,Auto,0,1.0,United Kingdom,2020-03-17,"I bought this device because my tire was leaking a bit of air but had a few more months of life left in it. It was leaking maybe a a quarter to half a bar every 2 weeks so I thought this is perfect. Since I bought the machine I've used it every other week to bring the tire pressure back in line. Usually I quickly check the other tires as well and if necessary give them a little top up to keep all 4 at equal pressure.I quite liked it, I liked it had an analogue dial instead of digital (though that's just a personal thing). It was compact and did the job. All in all I've used this device a handful off times.Until last Sunday, the machine cut out halfway through pumping.  Conveniently just after the return window closed. I did some basic trouble shooting, checked that the 12V plug in my car worked properly etc... But to no avail. If I have some time I might still open the machine and check the internals but all in all I'm quite disappointed.",1

Much better than putting a pound coin in a slot and having to dash about tyrying to inflate four tyres before your money runs out, straing to see a dial that's usully out of site. All depending on whether your garage pumop is working in the first place. A good investment.

Ring RAC610 In-Car Air Compressor for Cars and Commercial Vehicles 12 V / 85 W / 100 psi / 7 bar,Auto,0,3.0,United Kingdom,2020-01-12,Ive had this a while now. It works fine but seems to take a very long while. The gague is quite accurate but when you drive a 4x4 this inflator is not the quickest. The lenght of pipe from machine to tyre could be a bit longer it struggles with value at the top. It also vibrates quite alot. Prob very good for low usage in an emergency on a regular car tyre or bycycle.,0

Amazon Basics Microfibre Cleaning Cloths Pack of X,Auto,0,5.0,India,2020-01-21,"These are amazing for cleaning and a great price! I’m mad at myself for not purchasing sooner. In an effort to reduce the crazy amount of paper towels we go through, I decided to purchase these. I use 1-2 a day for kitchen cleanup and put them in the laundry. They pick up little crumbs easily and don’t leave my quartz “streaky.” I have a super messy 10 month old and I clean his highchair with these and they work wondetfully. I also use these for dusting, they pick up everything. The only thing that was a negative was that the first time I washed them in warm water (per instructions), the yellow color bled onto the white and turned them an off white color. Not a big deal to me because I use these only for cleaning and wash them with only other cleaning rags but be careful not to wash the yellow rags with anything you care about! Ieven though instructions say to hang dry, I dry them on low with no issues. Last thing, most people know this but don’t ever use fabric softener with these, they won’t be as absorbant",0

Jelly Belly 15 3D Air Freshener,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-01-12,"I love the Lemon-Flavoured Car Air Freshener. My other half and I bought it for our car, as we wanted something that is not very overpowering in terms of its smell, but which can enhance the air quality in our car.

To put things in perspective, we’re often behind high-polluting cars when WE DRIVE OUR CAR, and so the air vent in the car is usually closed, leaving the air quality in the car a bit stale at times.

The JELLY BEAN Car Air Freshener comes in a plastic casing, which it needs to stay in.

I had a bit of difficulty opening up the edge of the plastic casing. It’s best in my view to use a small scissors to cut a little opening on the edge of the plastic casing, IN ORDER TO ALLOW THE DISTINCTIVE SCENT OF THE AIR-FRESHENER TO SLOWLY SPREAD TO THE WHOLE OF THE CAR.

IN SUMMARY, my whole family love the distinctive mild scent of the JELLY BEAN CAR AIR FRESHENER. It reminds me of the lemon sweets I love to buy in the shops sometimes. I MUST STRESS THOUGH, as noted by some reviewers, it may not be to everyone’s taste!

Thanks for reading my Review and I hope you find it HELPFUL!",5

Castrol EDGE 5W-30 LL Engine Oil,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-04-30,"I bought a 2008 Golf plus 1.9 PD TDI, first I bought a filter and some cheaper oil from a well know UK supermarket to flush the engine, i ran the car for a 2 weeks at first then drained the oil and put the same 5w 30 in again which was noted to be the lower 504 oil for the car which needs changing more often anyway, I ran the car for another three days with a second load of economy brand oil then drained that after coming off the motorway, changed the oil for this product and again a new oil filter, I did this because the woman who owned it before me seemed to think swapping the oil every 12-18 months was good servicing EEK! Good servicing is every 6 months as a PD engine is extremely tough on oil
Anyway there was a significant difference in the engines running over all after it had a good flush out and then Castro, edge put in.

I have always used Castrol in my cars and Land Rover so I was delighted when VW recommend Castrol,

Please note if you have a PD engine it is extremely hard wearing on the oil so putting in quality oil will make a huge difference to the engines over all wear and I will be changing the oil every 6 months weather it needs it or not",15
Castrol EDGE 5W-30 LL Engine Oil,Auto,0,4.0,United Kingdom,2020-03-02,"I can't say that the mileage has increased after using this oil. That's because it depends on what supplier you use in the UK to fill up your tank. Shell, BP diesel always gives me a better mileage. The noticeable difference so far has been the heart beat of the engine. It's much quieter and I feel that the performance has improved greatly. Where I use to get a lag between the change of gears it much more smoother now and slight revs car kicks off with omph!",2

Castrol EDGE 5W-30 LL Engine Oil,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2019-12-14,"OK so this oil is not the cheapest, however it is far from the most expensive, in fact its probably at the lower end of the price spectrum.

I picked this as it was recommended by the VW dealership over the telephone. To be perfectly honest I was not expecting to notice any change in engine performance, the car is less than a year old old, however having purchased and put this into the car it really does seem to have had an effect on startup I can feel and hear.

The engine seems to startup much smoother than previously, maybe its a placebo effect. There wasn't an issue with the engine prior to putting this in but it really does seem smoother.

I initially only purchased a litre but am going to pick up some more and make sure I don't mix with anything inferior going forward!",0

They have become (to me at least) a safety tool covering blind spots, reversing between white lines with ease.

Blind Spot Mirrors For Cars - BeskooHome Waterproof 360°Rotatable Convex Rear View Mirror For Universal Cars -2 Pack,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-03-11,"I actually love these things, I can actually see the lines when I'm reversing into a bay, as well as the curb when I'm parallel parking! There's no need for me to adjust my mirrors which would take 3x the amount of time than it would to just use these. I'm about to taking my driving test (20 years old, i know i left it late :( I should have learned before i was in full time work, haha!) and I feel so much more secure about my maneuvers because of these mirrors. I've placed them on the outer edge of my mirror so that they don't obstruct my mirror at all, and you also get the option to fix them into position or to place them so that you can tilt them. I have them so that i can adjust the as i like having the option, plus i can choose the angle of them. They feel very secure on the mirrors too which is very nice.",4

"Autoglym Leather Cleaner, 500ml",Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-03-18,"Great leather cleaner. Leaves the leather looking factory fresh and doesn't leave a sticky residue. I use this cleaner on my leather steering wheel and it really does take the grime and shine off and leaves the leather with a factory matt finish. If you have a relatively new car the leather will have a clear coat protecting it, this stuff won't damage it as long as you don't use an abrasive scrubber. Because of the clear coat I don't bother buying the auto glym leather conditioner as it will just sit on top.",2
"Autoglym Leather Cleaner, 500ml",Auto,0,1.0,United Kingdom,2020-07-31,"Well, what a waste of my hard earned cash.  You may as well use soapy water.I purchased this to use with the matching leather balm.  YOU DON'T NEED THIS!The leather balm actually gets the leather cleaner than this stuff.  This doesn't appear to remove anything.I used a white soft cloth on our whole triple sofa, and the cloth was still bright white at the end.Had better luck with a mild soapy solution and then the leather balm.Just buy the leather balm.  This is useless.",2
"Autoglym Leather Cleaner, 500ml",Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-07-20,"Using this with a cloth is pretty pointless, but using it with a fairly soft boot polishing brush yeilds completely different results!This is the drivers seat of a 14 year old BMW with 70k miles and I don't think the seats had been cleaned once. I did a very quick half and half using circular motions and wiping away with a damp cloth and the results speak for themselves! I'm actually looking forward to doing the rest of the car",1
"Autoglym Leather Cleaner, 500ml",Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-02-12,"I bought this purely to get rid of the shine on my steering wheel. To be honest I’ve had many cars over the years and I thought once a steering wheel became shiny that was it. I saw Autoglyms YouTube channel where they used this to revive a shiny wheel so I thought it was worth a go. It does work. My wheel has a nice matt finish now, like it did when it was new. It also revived the drivers seat. Would recommend this.",1
"Autoglym Leather Cleaner, 500ml",Auto,0,1.0,United Kingdom,2020-07-17,"This did virtually nothing to the leather seats of my car.  I spent ages working it in, following the instructions, adding extra applications - no effect.  A little bit of fairly liquid and water did a better job.",1
"Autoglym Leather Cleaner, 500ml",Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-04-22,"Autoglym never seem to let us down for the car and leather furniture. Amazing how much dirt comes off.

"Autoglym Leather Cleaner, 500ml",Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-01-07,"Bought this thinking it would be OK, but I am amazed how well it cleans. Because of the light leather my seats get grubby quickly. However this cleaner just removed most of the dirt. Highly recommended.",2
"Autoglym Leather Cleaner, 500ml",Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-03-05,"I've used other brand leather cleaners before with varying results, but after using this one I wouldn't use any other. This really does clean very well with the help of a good stiff brush and a cloth. Brought my 11 year old car interior back to a lovely clean, as new condition. Use with the leather balm for superb results.",0
"Autoglym Leather Cleaner, 500ml",Auto,0,4.0,United Kingdom,2020-05-19,"This reminds me of CiF cream cleaner, it works but you’ve got to really put the effort it for it to work and doesn’t have a smell.

"Autoglym Leather Cleaner, 500ml",Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-05-08,"Was quite impressed how good this cleans light coloured leathers with little effort and brings the colour back. Leaves the finish a little matt, but then you are supposed to apply leather balm or similar after.",0
"Autoglym Leather Cleaner, 500ml",Auto,0,4.0,United Kingdom,2019-12-30,"Gave 4 stars as if cleaning really dirty leather it does take time and does not always get right into the grain but overall a very good product, smells fantastic and is great if used regular rather than letting leather get really soiled.",0
"Autoglym Leather Cleaner, 500ml",Auto,0,4.0,United Kingdom,2020-02-28,"Purchased to clean our leather sofa’s before ‘feeding my them with balm.Very easy to use, light scent only, works well on superficial dirt, but not so much on deeply marked areas.Recommend",0
"Autoglym Leather Cleaner, 500ml",Auto,0,2.0,United Kingdom,2020-07-19,"Applied it to some leather handlebar tape and leather bike seat. It smelled pretty strong, but made a negligible difference, if any at all, after three applications plus some hefty scrubbing. I'm not sure whether it is the nature of the stains (which are unknown to me) or the weakness of the product which is to blame, but figured I ought to report the outcome all the same!",0

When recipient started using it, it turned out a few problems. The built quality and design of this thing is lacking. Simple things like a powerful motor, durable cranking mechanism and piston/cylinder combination are toy-like. It's not going to last. Rubber legs (4 of them) are a joke, as seen on the provided picture. They fell off on first use. The danger and trouble of this is that screws get loose and fall inside, start rattling and jam into the open mechanism of the pump, such as crank, gears and other moving parts. Imagine what is going to happen if not fixed immediately... Overall it is very cheap looking device. On a positive side, the electronics built into it is rather advanced and versatile giving precise pressure measurement and action. The pump will auto-stop upon reaching a pre-set value. You need to take into account pressure readings difference when pump is running and is not. After a few trials and errors you will get a good hang of it. It is essential to take this thing apart before first use, inspect inside, lubricate it well, secure the rubber leg screws and make sure everything is right. Good luck with it, but it is not recommended unless improvements are made.",22

It was half the size of most portable compressors I've seen.  I was worried if it would even be able to perform properly.I was surprised at how fast this compressor actually worked.  I was able to inflate a tire from 30psi to 34psi in around 15seconds on a 235/45/17 tire.The auto shut off is a nice feature once you have set what you want the max pressure to be.  It does pump about 1psi higher than what you set in order to account for air loss when you remove the nozzle from the valve.This compressor lost a point due to the fact that the pressure reading had a tolerance of ±1.2psi and actually registers a lower reading than what the actual tire is at.  I verified this against 2 identical digital gauges that have a tolerance of ±0.2psi and they both read 35psi on one tire while this compressor read 34psi.  I then tested another tire that was registering 36.2psi on my other digital gauges while this compressor read 35psi.This compressor also lost another point for it's design.  There is nowhere to actually place the cord or the hose.  On my old compressor that was shaped similarly to this, I was actually able to just have the hose running along the top of the compressor and then I would wrap the cord around the entire unit to keep it all tidy.  Unfortunately, with the way this unit is designed and the placement of the handle, it is near impossible to wrap the cord and hose up without it becoming undone.",2

It has rubber feet so it doesn't move around and is quieter than the terrible one I'm replacing.

It has clear controls that let you select the air pressure you'd like and is smart enough to fill a couple PSI over the amount you've selected, knowing you will lose a little bit of air when you're removing the hose from your tire's stem.

I found this hose screws onto the tire stem much easier than other pumps/compressors I've used.

It's a great size. The cord is kind of a mess when you're not using it and would have loved if they included some kind of cord tie/management so that it was easy to wrap up when done.

But a great price and much better than paying to use the air machine at the gas station, while kneeling in dirt, broken glass or garbage. Or dealing with the hose that someone hasn't put back properly, which is now in knots and dirty.

Get this and do it at home, when your tires are cold, before your trips.",0

Now they're starting to charge $1 or $2.  And what happens in this cashless digital world when it's all contactless payment?  Buy your own tire inflator.  Whenever I swap out my winter tires, the pressure is usually low from being left in storage.  I often have to take it out to the gas station to pump it up.Drive in the snow or rain, get to the gas station, find some guy parking in the spot that has the air compressor.  Wait for him to take his time and then realize they want $1 and you got no coins?  Go inside the gas station and ask the cashier if they do cash back for $5 of coins.  Rinse and repeat next year...Get your own inflator!  After putting on my winters, I hook it up to my 12V input in the car and set the tire pressure, hit start and it stops when it's at the set pressure.  Yeah I like this way better.  I have one for every car in the family.  There are a few times when my pressure dropped and I was able to pump it up at the side of the road.

Some people complaining it doesn't fill to exact setting. Is it exact? IDK... give or take a PSI who cares. Makes zero difference in a tire a couple PSI one way or another. The temperature outside will affect the PSI more than that anyway.",1

I attached the hose to the tire valve, set the psi on the pump, flipped the switch and it filled to .5 psi above the set psi.  The instructions indicate it pumps slightly above to account for air loss when detaching the hose.  It worked consistently on all 4 tires.  I tested the psi with a mechanical pressure gage and it matched.  I should note that the first one I received was faulty and didn't work.  I contacted the seller and they quickly responded and sent me a replacement.  The replacement worked perfectly.",0

You don't lose nearly 1 psi disconnecting the hose but for some people it could be helpful. Quieter than i expected, and the little handle is nice. On a 225/50R17 takes about 7 seconds per pound (25 to 33 took a minute), on a larger truck tire 265/75R17 took about twice that. Gauge is accurate, checked it against 3 other pressure gauges. Only concern might be length of fill hose, if the valve stem is at the top you will have to set it on the tire or on a box or something as its not able to reach 30"" high.

Ring RAC610 In-Car Air Compressor for Cars and Commercial Vehicles 12 V / 85 W / 100 psi / 7 bar,Auto,0,4.0,United Kingdom,2020-05-04,"I wanted the cheapest one as a replacement for the other 'cheapest one' that I left in the company minibus taxi when I retired. It was one of these and it served me perfectly well for four years, and in that time I used it a lot, not just on my bus but others in the yard as well.

It is very noisy which is a bit of a bummer but for £13 what can one expect.

No bells or whistles. Plug it in (engine running if possible), and connect to the tyre valve as quickly as possible to reduce loosing too much pressure - then hit the yellow button and wait!

The gauge goes up - slowly - so when it reaches the desired pressure stop it by pushing the yellow button. Remove from the tyre valve as quickly and directly as possible to reduce pressure loss (which probably is insignificant anyway), and you're done.

Regarding the pressure readings on this unit please be aware of the following:-

Simply connecting this to your valve, although it will show pressure, will not be the pressure in your tyres, it will show lower by quite a bit, at least both the ones I have owned have. To get a more accurate reading you have to turn it on, then it will show you what pressure you have. But in this there is a degree of inaccuracy as the needle vibrates with the pump action about 1mm each side of the centre position which shows the pressure reading (if that makes sense).

Basically when the centre of the 'needle blur' reaches the desired pressure - turn it off.

Like I say, it works perfectly fine but I would still use a separate independent tyre pressure gauge like the RaceX.

As for the accuracy of the gauge on the Ring. After pumping up all four tyres on my car, which all require 2.4 bar (as read from the centre of the needle blur), I tested my tyre pressures with a RaceX pressure gauge, which is accurate. All four tyres were just under 0.2 of a 'bar over what the Ring gauge had indicated by the centre of the blurry needle...so I simply used the RaceX to release a little air at a time until I got them all to 2.4 bar. Not everyone is as particular as I so it might not matter to most people

Given that the needle blur makes dead-on reading accuracy pretty much impossible, I reckon that the gauge on this is more than adequate for the job.

For the price I cannot fault it.",1

Finally decided to test it yesterday and it doesn’t work! I went to a garage, filled my tyres to 35psi, and then used this. The dial told me I was at 20psi, and it did nothing about it - a massive amount of noise but no change in the air pressure.

So this item doesn’t work.

As others have noted this is not a charger to quickly get some juice into you battery in a hurry. If you need that then look at the other NOCO's that can push some bigger amps.
However, if like me, you just need a charger that can trickle charge your batteries back up to 100% over a day or so then look no further. Super easy to use, really nice packaging (not that this is very important but it really is a nicely designed box :) , it is also a nice compact device so takes up almost no storage space when not in use.

I bought this charger as we're all on lock-down in the UK at the moment and our cars haven't moved or started for +- 4 weeks. I've just finished charging both our car batteries; one is a 30Ah and the other a 45Ah.
So, even though NOCO say 'up to 30Ah' it will still work for bigger batteries. The 45Ah one was pretty flat - when I connected it up the charger LED pulsed red for a good 6/7 hours which suggests it was quite a long way below 75%. However, within 17 hours the LED had turned solid green which means it is now at 100%
The 30Ah battery took about 7 hours to turn green (but this wasn't as flat as the 45Ah)

Anyway, highly recommend this charger.",70

Bought to trickle-charge a motorbike on a LiFePo4 but also to double up and maintain another vehicle on a sealed acid. Obviously at 1A rating this is really just a trickle charge, so if you're after something to charge a battery from low to full in a short as space as possible, pick one of the higher rated versions, but for me needs this was perfect and so much cheaper than the equivalent Optimate.

Some useful facts that were not obvious until it arrived, that might help some people not waste money on additional accessories :
- It comes with 2 metres of cable so your battery needs to be within 2-and-a-bit metres of a wall socket
- On the end of that cable is a Noco-proprietary connector
- The unit then comes with some crocodile clips that plug in to this connector (on a short additional section of wire) to clip directly on a battery
- If you want to hard-wire the unit into a motorcycle, the crocodile clips include eyelet terminals so you can unscrew the crocodile clips, and you're left with simple ring terminals to screw onto a battery semi-permanently. So if you're looking to buy this for a bike, there's no need to buy any additional cable/adapter if you're happy with this arrangement.
- Selection of battery type is manual by a simple button-press, that cycles around the 3 options (convential 12v lead, 12v AGM, 12v Lithium). 6v and force-charge options are initiated with long button-presses.",129

They are rubbish - it does work.

After many weeks sitting in the drive during lock down, my 2L diesel car would not start. The radio was working and the locks opened, but when I tried to stat the engine, the starter turned over slowly and then died completely. So the battery had enough power for the electrics, but not enough to start the engine.

Trying to arrange someone to come and jump start it would have been difficult with lock down and social distancing, so one of these starters seemed like the perfect product. I looked at various models and brands, but they all had negative reviews. The NOCO was the one which looked most professional, but I was again put off by the many reviewers saying it was useless, didn't work, and in one case saying the RAC were laughing at it for being Mickey Mouse. If I had been relying on the Amazon reviews, I wouldn't have bought it. But I was telling a colleague about my car being dead, and it turned out they had this model, and they were raving about it. So I took the chance and bought this one (GB40)

Well the negative reviewers are either lying, or didn't read the instructions.. It's not junk, it's not a toy, and it really works.

I plugged it in to the wall when it arrived, and it was fully charged in a few hours. I didn't have time to take the car out for a drive that evening, so I just unplugged it and stuck it back in the box it came in.

Next evening, I connected the cables to the car battery, still a bit unsure whether it would work. The instructions didn't really clarify what to expect, but it initially made a clicking noise and seemed to be trying to read the battery. However, from the instructions, I knew I would need to press the boost button, which I did (for the specified 3 seconds), and the white LED came on as detailed.

Got into the car, turned the key, and bingo. It started first time. And the charging lights showed it was still green.

It was great to be able to choose when I want to start the car up, instead of having to arrange a jump start with someone else. And given the situation with lockdown, it's nice to know I've got this on hand in case the same thing happens. I can see why my colleague was raving about it - you know how much of a hassle jump starting your own or someone else's car is...and this just makes the whole thing a doddle. And since it's so small, it feels a bit magic too!

So do not be put off by the negative reviews. It was so easy to use and worked so reliably, I can't see why anyone would claim it's useless. I can only assume they didn't read the instructions (a hefty three or four simple paragraphs).",74

Her battery was so flat, there were no lights or clicks from the starter.  The GB40 started it, no problem.  A few weeks later, her battery was totally flat again and without an additional charge, the GB40 started it without any hesitation.  The battery reported 50% but I opted to fully charge it again.Cut to today...After working on my BMW 335 (3 litre petrol) for a few hours, the battery was too low to start it.  I had lights, locks etc but not quite enough amps to turn the engine.  I attached the 100% charged GB40 and to my amazement, it wouldn't start.  I enabled bypass mode in order to get the full 1000 amps (this is nonsense, it's closer to 500) but again, it wouldn't turn.  I left it for 30 seconds and tried again... it turned twice but too slow to start.  Another 60 seconds and the engine *just* about started.To suggest this would start a 6 litre petrol is absolute rubbish.  Had it been totally flat, or -10 outside, I might chalk it up to experience.  However, it's a chilly 8 degrees and the car battery was nowhere near flat... so the fact it struggled is a disappointment.If you have 1 litre hair dryer, it's great.If you have a 3 litre, look elsewhere.",6

I always carry jump leads which are fine, assuming you can find a friendly passing motorist, one who knows where his/her battery is located (not always obvious), is able to position the car so you can connect the two batteries etc etc.
So when I became aware that these power pack type starters were available I was intrigued. Too good to be true surely? Small and light enough to go in a glove box, with the promise of being able to start a car multiple times, even with a totally dead battery.
Well, all I can say is, it works!
Ironically, it was my daughter’s ‘modern’ - a Kia Picanto - which needed help after a few weeks of lockdown inactivity. Battery low enough that it wouldn’t crank the engine at all. So connect the clamps, plug them into the gizmo, press ‘on’ and start the car as usual. Bingo - first go!
I used it in a similar scenario a couple more times. Then today, I had to use it on a really dead battery. Same car, but this time no signs of electrical life at all - the central locking wouldn’t unlock, and turning the key didn’t even produce any dash lights, much less any clicking or starter whirring. Out of interest, I put a meter across the battery - 2.5 volts, so I think this battery (7 years old) is probably a goner. Out with the Noco, connect up, turn the key - nothing. At first I thought it had met its match. Then I remembered that if the battery is really low (below 2 volts says the booklet), it has to be set to manual override. Double check that the cables are connected with correct polarity, press and hold the override button, turn the key - bingo car started first go. Pretty impressive, I thought. The thing had been sitting in the garage for two weeks, still on its original charge from the day I got it, and still showing full charge on its LEDs.
There are lots of different makes of this kind of power pack available; I chose this after a bit of internet research. It seems to be a reputable make, and this device is well reviewed elsewhere.
Positives:
- very easy to use
- battery clamps are all metal and very substantial. They taper to a slim point so are easy to attach even if there’s not much space around the battery terminal posts
- can be charged from a mains USB charger, or from a car 12 volt socket as you drive along (adapter included)
- has a USB output as well, so can be used to charge a phone/tablet, plus a bright LED torch with SOS flashing option.
The only downsides I can see:
- only one USB out
- no 12v cigar-lighter type output to power car accessories
- the battery cables are very short, so you have to find somewhere close to the car’s battery to rest the device whilst you go to turn the key
This thing will now be coming with me whenever I’m out in an old car.

Sent back and replacement arrived, charged this one overnight. Not a great start. Replacement was a different revision so I suspect I was sent an old unit the first time round.

Vehicle Overview:
I have a 2.2L Mercedes Vito (2008).
I don't use the van very often. Normally once per month, during lockdown not at all for 2 months.
Van battery was completely flat (central locking didn't even work). Possibly have a drain somewhere.
Measured the battery voltage using fluke multimeter. Battery had 2.5V. So low.
New battery bought in January 2020 (top of the line Exide EA1000 series) so in good condition.

Using the product:
Connected GB40 and it wouldn't detect the battery.
Used boost function, first try unsuccessful, waited 30 seconds and on the second try it just about started.
GB40 battery down to 2 bars. Doubt at 2 bars its going to get past 2 more tries.

I am underwhelmed with this product. Again so many positive reviews. I wish peoples reviews contained some more detail. make, model, engine size, condition of battery. It would really help to inform people who purchase this product. I suspect the people who have had success have batteries that have a higher voltage aren't using the boost function. I suspect when using the boost function that during the 30 second wait it delivers some high current charge to the battery to try and raise the voltage level. That's why when you do finally turn it over you end up with half a battery left.

I am going to charge one more time and see if it will start from flat. Imagine what it will be like in a years time with some battery degradation! If I'm not convinced on the next try then I suspect it will be sent back. Maybe the manufacturer should be a bit more transparent about where it gets their claims from. I can imagine it working 20x if it was used on a 0.8l, 3 cylinder petrol car that is only struggling to start and not completely dead. i.e a car with a battery that has some residual potential energy left in it and then an engine with low cranking amps.

Using the product for the second time:
Results from second try (remember the battery is in better condition this time after a short time running the day before). Would not start at all! Battery pack down to 2 bars after first try, failed to even try again so thats a grand total of one try. Returned replacement item too.

Postage:
Just to add insult to injury. Amazon will only refund £4.75 of postage. They also suggest tracked and given the value i wouldn't send it any other way. It cost me £11.00 each to send it back so I am left out of pocket for the return postage costs.

Next steps:
Jumped started the van using jump leads, started first time.
Charged battery to a reasonable level by going for a drive
Bought a solar panel and charge controller.
Installed and waiting to see if this can maintain the battery.",2

Like most modern cars, my 1 series with all the electronics and sensors, doesn’t take long to drain the battery. So this turned out to be very handy in this situation.

It’s simple enough to use. Once you give it a charge for about 3 hours, it should be full and ready to get going.

So long as you know how to safely connect to contact points of your car battery, it’s as simple as connecting it and switching on ignition. No need for help from someone else and their car to jump start

In some cases where the battery is practically dead, the manual override function will be needed. Which was the case for me. The battery was so dead that I couldn’t even unlock it with the remote and there were no dashboard lights/prompts.

In order to do this you press-hold on the manual override button for 2-3 seconds until all lights flash on the device. Give it 30 secs to tick and then press ignition to start.

Overall this will solve most car start issues if it’s associated to a low/dead battery.

The product is great and simple to use, but the manual could provide more instructions. For example, it didn’t elaborate much on the manual override functions purpose for dead battery vs normal function for low battery.",1

Didn't want to call out AA and make contact with someone so went online and ordered this unit based on the reviews on youtube. It comes well packaged, bit too well packaged.

What can i say, worked for me first time. Always make sure to charge your battery to the max and make sure to use it warm. Giving it one last charge before placing it in a nice Noco cloth bag it comes with, then into my car.

only nag is it doesn't come charged (<25%), and the power supply is just a usb to usb micro cable. It comes with a car 12V charger to usb socket but no uk wall plug to usb. So make sure to charge using a normal 5v mobile charger. That's the max.",19

The device is presented very well, the packaging is high quality.

The device itself is compact and packs the features you'll need for a trickle charger.

The clips whilst small have a lot of gripping force so not likely to slip off a battery terminal.

Plenty of length on the cables if you're relatively close to a power outlet, however don't expect to run this from the far end of your garage and up the driveway.

The clips can be unscrewed which leave you with the o ring connectors if you want to form a permanent connector.

I have this connected to a motorcycle battery and there's enough cable to route it nice and tidy.

The single led light indicates what the status is of the battery and what the charger is doing about it.

For those wondering, this does not jump start a battery. It merely charges it and it won't charge a battery from flat to the turning your engine in minutes it takes hours. This is designed to slowly top the battery up.

This has been key for me since buying heated grips on my bike.

I would recommend this as opposed to cheaper decides on amazon. The fact the bulk of the device sits in the plug socket makes stuff much tidier",44

This charger is designed in the USA and made in China – it claims to be suitable for charging all types of battery but with larger ones taking longer to do so from flat. The average small car battery capacity starts at around 45Ah, but for comparing NOCO models the manufacturer states: “the GENIUS1 can charge a 100 amp-hour battery, but it will be an extended charge time if the battery is completely dead. For example, the GENIUS1 would take roughly 76-hours to recharge a dead battery. For comparison, the GENIUS2 would be 37-hours, the GENIUS5 would be 15-hours and the GENIUS10 would be 7-hours”.This is a smart battery charger that is simple to use – just plug it in, connect it to your battery, select a charge mode, and start charging; it is fully-automatic with a temperature sensor for year-round use. The NOCO GENIUS1UK is currently around thirty-five pounds from Amazon, making it mid-price, with similar models starting at under twenty pounds. However, this is a well made product that has some clever features and works as expected – even on larger batteries. Four stars for value at the current price – it should work with your own battery but it may take a long time to fully charge a completely flat one.",2

I wanted this one for maintaining and charging sealed lead acid batteries of the types used in intruder alarms and battery back up UPS for computers as most UPS internal float chargers tend to not condition the batteries .
Hence I take the battery out and place it on charge with units like the GENIUS1UK.
It did work with one battery but took 3 days (!) to charge a 12V 7A/H as opposed to the supposed 6 hours.

This Smart charger gradually backs off the rate from the full 1Amp down to almost nothing as the battery approaches the correct state of charge, and will not allow the battery to overheat or overcharge.

It is designed for a range of technologies including assorted Lead-Acid types and BMS Lithium. The suggested target size is up to 30Ah, but most people will be using it on smaller batteries to achieve a reasonable re-charge time.

The UK suffix means it works on 240V and has a 13A plug as part of the body.

It has an assortment of indicator LEDs to show the status of the battery and charger; Charge, three 12V Modes, 6V Mode, Standby, Over-voltage error, Bad Battery error, Reversed Polarity error.

Being switch-mode it is much lighter than a comparable linear supply, and also barely gets warm even at the full charge rate. The sealed plastic case only claims to be IP60 but it looks to be beer and splash resistant. Obviously because of the 13A plug pins it is for indoors use only.

It looks solidly made with an ABS body which is rated with IP65 Ingress protection although as it is plugged directly in a mains socket. While the product is designed in the USA it is manufactured in China.

The leads supplied have both substantial sprung clips and integrated terminals for a more permanent connection. I have used these on my classic Suzuki motorcycle so that I just need to connect the charger with its connector under the seat. The charger is compact and has an integrated UK plug in the body along with a generous 2.2M lead. The connecting lead can add a further 55cm.

This is a smart charger suitable for both charging lead-acid, AGM, and lithium car and other vehicle batteries or maintaining their charge. It has a mode button at the front but also detects the type of battery as well as whether it is 6 or 12 volts and the state of its charge. It correctly identified my motorcycle as 6V and charged it to full capacity. It can be left on without fear of overcharging as it adjusts the current supplied.

This charger is ideal for keeping a battery topped up and conditioned in a classic car or motorcycle or for anything that is not used regularly such as a ride on mower or camper van and is compact but surprisingly well-featured. If you need to charge flat batteries you probably need to consider a charger with a greater current delivery but for maintaining charge or topping up this one is a good solution.",15

For wet cell batteries there’s an option to charge at 6v as well as at 12v.

The kit is extremely compact. You get a charger and interchangeable connector which plugs into the mains with around a two-metre cable length. A 50cm+ battery clamp cable links to this and firmly attaches to respective positive and negative terminals.

This cable will not allow you to jump-start a car - well unless you wait for several hours for the battery to be charged. What it does do is maintain a battery charge or slowly increase that charge. As such it works well.

Negatives, well you really need to maintain the instructions to figure out which charging mode to use, and you’ll need to be able to tell the difference between a lithium and wet cell battery. The indicators on the charger itself are not particularly intuitive.

Overall though a decent product. Four stars.",1

You could house this in a weather proof box outside and trail the leads under the bonnet and potentially even close it if necessary? It will slowly build up charge, prevent overcharging and supply a trickle charge where required. This is exactly what I need for a car that is only driven a few months of the year. Nice long leads, fused protected and different charging cycles for very different battery technologies and voltages. I have purchased cheaper units in the past but not of this quality. The leads and clips are robust and the unit has all the necessary safety markings.",0

It will charge a whole range of different battery types and sizes.First thing to note; the leads are longer than the amazon product info states!  The diagram shoes 217mm and 55mm of lead length between the two parts of the lead - this should read cms!!! So you have nearly 3 metres of lead length from the plug, not the 27cm or so they indicate!!!  You will still probably need to use an extension lead unless you’re able to park your car’s battery near a plug (not so much of an issue of you’re charging off-vehicle!)The packaging is very smart and neat.  The unit itself is very small - about the size of a 12v adapter you might get on a string of Christmas lights! The leads come in two parts - one part attached to the unit itself and then a pair of crocodile clips which plug onto that lead with 55cm of additional length.Easy to select the voltage of the battery and useful if you have older 6v vehicles as well as modern 12v.  Also particularly useful is the Force function.  If your battery is completely flat you can use this to kickstart a charge.  I was once caught out by a cheap trickle charger from LIDL which didn’t tell you that it would work unless there was a certain amount of voltage still in the battery.  This is much more useful!All in all a great bit of kit if you want to maintain a variety of  vehicle batteries.",0

It's by no means a jump starter or something designed to be used on the road but it is highly versatile and can be used with lithium and lead-acid batteries in 6 and 12 volt configurations. So if you don't mind waiting 3 days (depending on how march charge you have) a car battery is doable. It comes with comprehensive instructions.,0

This little gadget can fully charge it from flat or can help top up a low battery and keep it topped up.

In my case there was insufficient charge in my battery to start up my car, this device fully charged it in around 3 days which is an awfully long time but it only uses a trickle charge. Another negative is that because there are lots of modes it is useful to keep hold of the instructions as not to put the device into the incorrect mode.

But using it could not be simpler, easy to store as its very compact and has interchangeable connectors which are also very handy. Overall it does the job!",1

It will happily charge six and 12 V batteries of all different types although I have only tried it on a 12 V AGM car battery in my BMW. It's an ideal way to top up your battery during the winter months where they sometimes suffer more drain than usual especially for people making short journeys. Alternatively if you have a project car or something that isn't run very often this makes a great solution for unattended maintenance. It can be left on 24 seven and can completely monitor and keep the battery condition perfect. It didn't seem to get hot at all whilst it was conditioning my battery so I have complete confidence in it.

3.4l Porsche petrol engine. Battery flat, solenoid just clicking, engine not moving.

Noco GB40 was cold (6C), I had kept in my classic car in the garage for 3 months. GB40 read 50% on the LEDS.

Connected it up, initially cranking was mega slow, After about 5 turns of the key, cranking sped up and engine fired.

I think it's great.

The swelling battery problems are a worry. Amazon should refund these on safety grounds",0

At week 11 one was dead. Ok so a £100 gadget, not cheap. But it worked straight away. I don’t have a drive so a trickle charge was not an option neither was removing the battery. So I went for the GB40, I looked at YouTube videos and thought I’d give it a go. NOCO is a top brand not a cheap replica company, build quality is very good, operationally very simple to use & added features like a built in torch enables you to do this job in the dark etc. Also there is a usb outlet to charge your smartphone lol i wonder how many months that would last! At half the cost of a new battery I was happy to buy this, use it (and after fully recharging the GB40) pack it in it’s supplied carry bag then put it in the boot in case I need it again. Brilliant piece of mind kit.Updated news 1/7/20Just lent it to a mate who also had a lockdown flat battery. Took three jumps as his car wouldn’t even unlock the doors battery was so drained. And it was still half full on the gb40 battery. Saved him a call out and a trip to the garage. Can’t rate it any higher!!",1

No more stringing jumper cables between stranger's cars on a dark night, no trying to remember the order of connection between cars, no fear of just getting out there and doing it themselves.  Everyone should have one of these in their emergency roadside kit!",1012

The rubber feet also keeps it from moving when operating.  I did notice it seems to get hot fairly fast so I've not sure how it will perform inflating a completely flat tire.

My neighbour brought his booster over (not same brand) and the car turned over instantly.  It only comes with a one year warranty (which I'm just barely over)  but thought I'd contact the manufacturer anyway to see if there was anything that could be done or find out how to trouble shoot.

Dislike that it is really a cheap plastic light weight housing & the compressor is pretty weak.  For example, it took 10 minutes or so to inflate the 4 tires on my late model pickup truck to 35 lbs (note they were each down 3-4 lbs due to a recent cold spell).  So the rate of inflation was only about 1.5 lbs per minute.  And it was very hot after the 10 minutes were up, I would not want to stretch it to 15 minutes of continuous use before powering off for awhile.  So if your tires are only a few lbs down, it should suffice.  If you are trying to inflate an empty or near empty tire, forget about it, it would probably burn out first.",6

I had a different one prior, & somehow... I used it on a friend's car, and their car must have had an electrical issue w/ their car, because it fried the fuse and melted the ""lighter"" end of the power cord just enough to ruin it.

I purchased this one and it was delivered earlier than expected, because I was going out of town over the weekend, and I was able to use this compressor to fill my car tires, along with my bicycle tires, when I arrived at my destination.

Each time, I programmed/set the tire pressure value I wanted, and the air compressor filled the tire(s) up to that set number, and automatically stops - just a great feature!

*** NOTE - this goes .5 PSI above the set PSI you enter / probably because .5 PSI will come out of the tire, while you unplug the valve plug/intake cord from your tire ***

Support was amazing for this product. I emailed them, submitted my Amzn order # and they shipped me a replacement unit ASAP. Great support team and again new unit is working fine. The pump comes on when switch is flipped. Moving back to 4*'s.
Suggestion the unit should come with a bag or pouch to carry the unit in while stored in trunk. As of now its just still in the box.

1st Review: This past Thursday I went to use this unit for the 2nd time since buying it in September 2019. Its been in my garage since. I needed to fill my tires and during the filling up of the 1st tire the unit just stopped pumping. I set the pressure to 33lbs and it stopped at 28lbs. I tried flipping the switch and nothing. The unit's pump broke. It won't pump. The unit still has power as the LED and the Flashlight lights up but the pump broke. Giving this a 1* till I hear back from AstroAi support. Emailed them and now waiting for a reply. If unit breaks on 2nd use its garbage. Hopefully they can make this right.",1

This little guy is going to save me a lot of time and trips to the gas station when my car tires are low.  Quite often when my car tire pressure indicator will warn me that my tire pressure is low I put off going stopping to inflate them because I either don't have the quarters, the pump  at the station is broken, or I just do not feel like dealing with stopping. The pump is very easy to use and I love the fact that I can set the PSI and the pump stops when the pressure is met. No more fighting with the long pump hose and racing against time with using the pressure gauge. This will have all 4 tires at the same PSI each time...which saves on wear of my tire tread. So far, I am very happy with this sturdy little guy.",0

It's much faster than compressors I bought at Sears years ago for twice as much. Sears is long gone...hope this pump lasts for many more refills.

Check your owner's manual to see the Amps on your cigarette lighters. This will work on a 10 Amp lighter socket, but it's better to plug it into a 15 or 20 Amp, as it may draw 15 Amps in reality, like quite a few other pumps.

It did start the SUV every time. The ground clamp on it has lost 2 small pieces of plastic all ready even though it has not been abused. This does not affect usage but does make me question the quality of material used. The jumpers are a little short in my opinion. The jumper wires on it are on the wrong sides most of the time ( they are crossed when you use it ). I checked YOUTUBE its not just me. NOCO says this jumper starter is NOT to be stored at a temperature colder than -20C and in a place with an average temperature from  0C  to  +25C . So if you want this for winter use in Canada do not leave it in your car, instead get someone to give you a boost and wonder why you bought it. I rarely need a boost unless its colder than -20 and I am not at home to plug my car in. If not in the car why have it ??  I left this in my car at -29C once and had to use it, it did work - barely and the power was drained 50% after one use .I suggest anyone looking at this item  watch the YOUTUBE video PROJECT FARM JUMP STARTER . If buying NOCO for cold weather get A NOCO 50 or 70 if you can afford it.  Might not be for life in Alberta.

The manufacturer reached out to me and explained the pump is only suitable for bike and car tires. They issued a full refund so that in its self I think deserves 5 stars for customer service. They informed me they do not have an option for truck tires.

My first real use and the pump died on me. I aired down my tires to drive on the beach with the expectation of using this pump to air back up and it just wasn’t up to the task... I filled my front 2 tires and on the 3rd it gave up half way.

This pump is suppose to do 70psi advertised, and it did... just not more than once apparently.

I’m giving 2 starts only because I’m using on a heavy rig with high PSI. On a standard car it would probably be fine.",0

Not a good first experience with a NOCO product. Will most likely not be purchasing any of their stuff again.,1

The first car still had a little juice and started on the first try with the NOCO GB40.  The second car battery was completely dead.  No power left whatsoever.

I am happy to have it with me in the trunk if my battery were to fail, and that is very frustrating and time consuming if it does. This way you save on time which is worth a lot if you need to be somewhere especially in the Winter months. Make sure to read the instructions before use, and to understand what NOCO is explaining before using.Dislikes: I do however wish it came with a case instead of a bag, but I guess it keeps their cost down. Also if it came with a Wall charger(5V 2A) along with the existing cigarette charger (5V 2.1A).",0

Plugged the jump pack in and after letting it charge the car a little (and the car getting enough juice to set off the alarm!) we were able to start the car right up.

The clamps are very strong, but we didn't have any issues attaching them to the battery terminals. We have no problems hooking things up in the correct orientation.

I ended up encountering a low tire pressure light a few weeks after purchase. Sure enough, when I plugged this device into the lighter port in the vehicle and quickly fastened the nozzle to a rear tire, it was at 21 psi. It took only seconds to set the desired pressure level on the device. I flicked the switch, and within a few minutes the tire was back up to 32 psi and the indicator light on the vehicle switched off. I remember my dad having a big ol' honkin' air compressor in our garage growing up, and thinking it was nifty but bulky, heavy and probably expensive. The fact that this device can do the job, and is crazy portable, light weight, and inexpensive is awesome. It belongs in every vehicle or garage.

WindGallop Digital Car Tyre Inflator Air Tool Portable Air Compressor Car Tyre Pump Automatic 12V Electric Air Pump Tyre Inflation With Tyre Pressure Gauge Valve Adaptors Led Light,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-03-30,I bought this to replace my old noisy air compressor. It's a a cool looking compact portable air compressor with high power performance. It could inflate  a tyre upto 100 PSI. It claims to offer 10 minutes of continuous usage although I never used for continuous 10 minutes. it has a bright LED light that makes reinflating a tyre easy in the night time or could help to do a repair in darker environment. It is very efficient in emergency situation. The large clearly lit LED display digital pressure gauge enables you to easily calculate required pressure. It also allows you to preset required pressure and then automatically switches off when it reaches the required pressure which takes away the worry of over and underinflating the tyre. It comes with a long power code which easily reaches all the tyres. It has three additional adaptors to use with other inflatebale object.I am very happy with the product.,39

WindGallop Digital Car Tyre Inflator Air Tool Portable Air Compressor Car Tyre Pump Automatic 12V Electric Air Pump Tyre Inflation With Tyre Pressure Gauge Valve Adaptors Led Light,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-07-06,"Bought this out of necessity as I had a bit of a flat tyre coming back from Asda last Saturday. It arrived on time and it was soon in action.

I was able to inflate my near flat 10psi front left tyre on my Nissan Note very quickly. I turned on the car engine as instructed plugged the connector into the cigarette lighter, set the correct pressure via the digital display and switches and connected up the unit to the tyre in question.

I turned it on and off it went.

It was all done in 5 mins.

My only foible is the fact it needs the car engine to be running..but this goes for 99% of the alternatives as well.

But overall this is a nice piece of kit which works well, is easy to use and doesn't cost the earth.

The built in torch is a useful feature in the event of a night-time event and works while the machine is plugged into the cabin 12V socket. There are three vehicles at my home and I wanted something quicker and easier than a footpump. It's not too noisy to use on a Sunday morning when the neighbours are enjoying a lie in and I checked and pumped up the tyres on three vehicles quickly and easily in less than 15 minutes. As a pump for weekend car tyre maintenance it's ideal and the machine is easy to use but make sure you haven't already got one as part of your car's standard emergency toolkit in the boot already.  It worked straight out of the box and I am pleased with it.  Fingers crossed it will provide many years of faithful service and thus far I believe it will.,0

Autosol Metal Polish,Auto,0,4.0,United Kingdom,2020-07-09,"Reviewed July 2020. Use this as a general purpose metal polish around the house, its not the first time I've bought/used it, but it replaced some of the Peek brand which I picked up in the US, and I think Autosol is better.

Used for a number of things I can recently think of..

Wife has a couple of old Singer sewing machines that we are slowly getting back to use. They have some metal trim, Its been great to clean up the tarnish/oxidisation. Sometimes I've used a polling bit on a dremmel to get into the nooks and crannies.

I shave with old style 'double edge' (or DE) razors, and they quickly get clogged up with dried shaving soap. Every now and again I give my current razor a good clean and then a polish up with autosol. I think they are chrome plated, not show chrome, more of an industrial, long lasting finish.

I've been restoring some old fishing reels that are cast metal under the old paint finish. After stripping the old paint off (using a paint stripper), I've used autosol and a lot of elbow grease to bring the bare metal to a polished finish, which I'm really pleased with. (to the extent I don't want to use it on the fishing bank and get it dirty!).

Finally, we had a rust mark in our stainless steel kitchen sink where an empty can of baked beans was left over the weekend and left a rusty circle. Autosol removed it, and blended the area in with the surrounds so it was unnoticeable.

Solvol is great to bring a lustre to metal, including removing oxidisation, but its not going to repair damage, so if chrome has been pitted or flaking, it's not going to magically replace it, But what it will do is clean it up and make it a lot more presentable.",2
Autosol Metal Polish,Auto,0,2.0,United Kingdom,2020-01-03,"Used to clean and polish an old slightly tarnished and lightly pitted aluminium lampshade, it did not work as well as I had hoped, it did polish the finish to a degree but the paste turns dark grey as you polish and its very hard to then fully remove from any grooves or pitting so leaves them dark and more noticeable, I used an electric polisher/buffer and also hand buffed, I did not expect an as new finish as its a vintage shade with age related imperfections but I could not get a good finish and could not fully remove the greyed polish in parts, wish I’d have used something else or left it as it was because it looks odd now partially polished with dark patches here and there with more visible imperfections now than before, the product would probably be good on an even untarnished surface",6
Autosol Metal Polish,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-04-24,"I was advised to use this polish by a group of people cleaning Church silver and brassware during their annual renovations. I was surprised to find it was a product intended for cleaning chrome on cars rather than being specifically for silver or brass.I have always used polishes intended for specific metals in the past and was a bit doubtful, even though I had seen it in action.Having armed myself with the usual protective gloves, table covers and several cloths I started on the usually lengthy and very dirty process of cleaning my large collection of antique brass ornaments and picture frames.Immediately I noticed the difference as previously I regarded this as a ""filthy job""!  The main difference was far less of the black mess on metal surfaces and cloths. I left it on for a little while amazingly only needed a single cloth to polish all to a brilliant shine without the usual need for several cloths to polish off any residue.My brasses are still bright after 3 weeks, though I did treat the surfaces with protective Renaissance Wax. So far there is no evidence of any need to re-polish as all are still very bright and no sign of the slight dullness that usually starts to appear after a few days.",8
Autosol Metal Polish,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-06-29,"I havnt used this product for at least 30 years and I wasnt even sure if it still existed. I searched and it does so I ordered it in the hope that it was as good as I remembered it. Guess what? It is !! I needed this to polish my stainless steel gazing ball fountain in the garden and also my chrome motorcycle exhaust down pipes which have ""blued"" from the heat (which is what I used it for all those years ago) and its as good as it always was. So easy to rub on with a soft cloth, removing discolouration and minor scratches and then effortlessly polish off with a clean cloth. Brilliant stuff. Highly recommended.",1
Autosol Metal Polish,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-06-18,I’ve heard about this product many times but have only just purchased it. ITS TRULY AMAZING and I don’t like to waste money but this was incredible value. I wanted this to polish my exhaust tips in particular and I haven’t been disappointed. The more you use it - the better the results. My exhaust tips were was black but after some mild effort - they’re as good as new. Don’t buy anything else for your metal other than this.  Make sure the one you purchase is for the metal you want to treat but apart from that it’s excellent.,1

Autoglym Super Resin Polish,Auto,0,4.0,United Kingdom,2020-05-18,"Let me get the cons outta the way first. I bought this to remove some spider scratches I had. I used a 3 stage system or a rotary disc. Firm pad, softer pad and finally buffing with a microfiber cloth. None of the small spider scratches were removed. Even though it was spread evenly at slow speed until it covered the tank in only a thing film it did start to splatter (somehow) off onto the rest of the bike paint work. This was pretty annoying as it will destroy the plastic/matte paint. I had to spend a considerable amount of time cleaning this up and no matter how little or how long I'd use it for the same thing happened over and over. Pros It did clean the film on the tank of the motorcycle to a pristine shine and removed all cloudiness. The tank has never shined like this before, honestly.  2 pass overs of each panel (3) used about half the bottle, I was surprised. After using Muc-Off carnuba wax/polish on the -entire- motorbike I'd polished it to a wet shine with just under 1/3 of the container used. Opt for a bigger size, I bought the 325ml but you'll need much more for a car I assume.",1
Autoglym Super Resin Polish,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-06-01,"Works a treat!

I first used clay bar on my car and then rinsed the and done a quick wash. Looked and a few YouTube videos and easily applied it to the car and buffed it away by hand. You can actually feel the difference now. A week later went to wash my car and you could still see that there’s a nice protective layer on top which made cleaning the car very easy!

Note that this was the first time I Clay bar’d and polished my car and love the finish it gave. Would highly recommend it to any one and it’s very easy for beginners!!!",1

Autoglym Super Resin Polish,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-05-30,"Although more of a resin than a traditional polish, SRP has some abbrasive properties to remove very fine swirles. However, the main purpose of this product is to fill scratchs and mask imperfections, thus enhancing gloss and providing a temporary layer of protection to the paint. Even when used on it’s own, SRP yields impressive results and it does have some temporary hydrophobic qualities. However, for best results use a clay bar before application and seal with a paste wax to finish. Results speak for themselves.",2

Autoglym Super Resin Polish,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-06-25,"As with all AutoGlym products you just can’t go wrong. This works wonders on the paintwork. I’ve attached a before and after picture and you can see that the paintwork is a lot glossier and slightly darker after polishing which really enhances the image of the car in my opinion.

Really easy to use and you don’t need all that much although I was quite liberal with the application. Couldn’t answer the longevity star rating as I don’t know yet but if it’s anything like the Rapid Aqua wax then you can expect 2-3 weeks of rain resistance.

Would definitely buy again.",0

Autoglym Super Resin Polish,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-07-27,"Takes some time and effort to apply, but the results are amazing! Helps to reduce swirls from previous washes and polishing. Not as aggressive as T-cut, but don’t need to use every wash & polish. Probably Only 3 or 4 times a year, with a good wax polish.",0

Autoglym Super Resin Polish,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-01-10,"This restored shine in my 2003 Peugeot 206, and that is something to live up too - it doesn't last as long than on new cars however it does an amazing job for how old the car is. I tried various products like T cut but sadly they didn't do a good job at all really. Aquaglym was the only one that actually promised results and actually did it. I would also recommend their odour remover as that makes your old car smell heavenly and it's long lasting too. All their products may be a bit expensive, but for the results they give they are more than worth it",0

I purchased this battery jumper because I needed something to jump a friend's boat that always died after it sat too long also to have kept inside of my truck in case of an emergency. I chose Noco because I also have a small charger for 12v batteries that they make. I love the Noco quality and high tech look of the products they make.
When My battery jumper arrived it was well packaged with nice bright pictures. Everything was there and it even included a nice soft case to fit everything in.
I wanted to use this for a jump on a friend's boat, so I hooked it up and turned the boat key and boom started right up!
Some of the things I loved about it were that it was the size, would fit nicely in my truck under the seat for those emergencies on the road or just to help out unfortunate people whose car battery died. This thing also charges phones as a bonus! Love the fact that it has nice leds on the front that work in different patterns as well and to light up the engine area in the dark.
I think anyone looking for a nice compact, quality battery jumper easy to store and have for emergencies this is the one to get. I would recommend this product for sure.",18

One hadnt been started for a month but door ding and inside lights worked ok. and after 15 mins of this battery hooked up after unplugging it as fully charged from my house, the car starter didnt even click once. It was a 4 cylinder 2.0 liter

2nd car went in to work and came out 1 year old battery dead at -14 degrees. Lights and fan worked but clicking starter. Tried to hook this on for 15 mins. Tried starting several times and click click click. It was 2015 4 cylinder Jeep Patriot

Both times had to get out the big guns and hook 20 year old set of jumper cables to the cars with wifes running car and wait about 3 mins. Then both cars started fine.

Very very very very very very disappointed with this product and with selling it as a jump starting product. It will never ever start anything even a 2 L 4 cylinder engine.

Nice LED flashlight. Thats about it

Also will not go back in the box now forcing me to buy some extra 20.00 case to tag it along as an extra phone charger or flashlight. Otherwise the box rips in half and parts go tumbling everywhere

Save your money and buy a 12.00 set of jumper cables and throw them in your trunk.",8

"NOCO Boost Plus GB40 1000A 12V UltraSafe Portable Lithium Jump Starter, Car Battery Booster Pack, USB Powerbank, and Jump Leads for up to 6.0 Liter Petrol and 3.0 Liter Diesel Engines",Auto,0,2.0,United States,2020-06-09,"NOCO makes some really appealing products, and this is surely one of them... if only it worked as well as it claimed.

I've got several old cars which are kept in storage over the winter. They often need some help starting in the spring. Typically I use an AC-powered charger/starter to first charge the battery for 15 minutes or so, then, if needed, use the start-assist to turn-over the engine. This is a bit of a pain, hauling the bulky AC charger around, running an extension cord, waiting for the charge, etc. And the start-assist, at 100A, really didn't give that much of an assist.

I happened across this GB40 ""1000A"" booster, and figured I'd give it a try. I put 1000A in quotes because the real output of this unit is probably closer to 200A, and is available for only a couple of seconds. But even just 200A is twice the output of my AC charger.

I tried this first on my old VW diesel truck. With a 1.9 liter engine, it's well below the published 3 liter diesel rating. Even though it was a 70-degree June afternoon, to make the conditions as favorable as possible, I plugged in the engine heater for half-an-hour before trying to start it.

Without the booster, when I turned the key, I just got a click from the solenoid - the engine did not turn at all. When I attached the booster, I was able to get the engine to turn... slowly... once... and that was it. Nowhere near enough to start the engine. I then tried leaving the booster connected for 30 seconds before cranking, as recommended in the instructions. Same outcome. At that point the red temperature light started flashing on the unit, and I shut it off to allow it to cool. I tried again about a half hour later, still no luck.

After failing to start the engine with the NOCO booster, I hooked up a set of jumper cables to another car, and presto, the truck started right up, no problem.

Test #1 - completely dead battery. 1.9l diesel: Fail.

I tried it again this afternoon, on a 2015 Subaru with a 2.5 liter gasoline engine. Without the booster, when I turned the key, the engine turned two or three times... slowly... and slower... but wouldn't start. When I attached the booster, the engine started right up.

Test #2 - low battery, 2.5l gasoline engine: Pass.

The ease of use and quality of the unit is excellent. The LED light is handy. (NOCO: Is an SOS flasher really necessary? Just because you can doesn't mean you should.) I wish the cables were a bit longer - in both tests, I had to place he unit in a slightly precarious location, at risk of sliding/falling when the engine started. An extra 8-10 inches would have made a big difference.

I will say that the ""needle nose"" battery clamps on this unit (apparently the same on the GB20) are the best I have ever used. They're well-insulated, open very wide, and the narrow profile of the jaws allows them to fit where other clamps wouldn't.

In summary, while the NOCO GB40 booster did provide a noticeable start assist - better than my 100A AC-powered starter, and impressive given the unit weighs just over 1 LB - if I can't count on it to start the car when the battery is completely dead, the device is useless. I'd be willing to bet the larger capacity models - GB70 or GB150 - would do the job with a completely flat battery... but at $200-$300, I'm not sure it's worth the cost, and it would be yet another [expensive] battery I'd need to maintain.",3
"NOCO Boost Plus GB40 1000A 12V UltraSafe Portable Lithium Jump Starter, Car Battery Booster Pack, USB Powerbank, and Jump Leads for up to 6.0 Liter Petrol and 3.0 Liter Diesel Engines",Auto,0,4.0,United States,2020-06-04,"After doing the research and coming up with the NOCO GB40 as the best unit to purchase for my truck.  When I opened the package, I realized that the cables were far too short. The maximum distance the clips can reach from one another is about 22.5"".  This limits the ability to place the unit in a safe location where it will not slip and fall.I used it to jump my fathers SUV and it worked well.  I worked with what I had and it started the car just fine.  By fine, I mean that the turnover on the SUV wasn't overly sluggish.Personally, I also have a newer vehicle.  One where access to the negative terminal is blocked by other components of the engine.  In order to connect this, I would need to pop out a wrench and disconnect something.  Rather than do that, my thought was that I could just connect the negative to the vehicle frame. This seems to be more frequently recommended in recent research.More frustration comes from the fact that No.co does not offer longer cables (nor an extension) as an accessory.  Since they use what seems to be a proprietary ""x-connector"", finding a solution outside of No.co is not likely.  At this point, users may need to resort to building their own longer cable.  Perhaps even clipping and extending the negative cable with some 8AWG and shrink tubing.",5

It's got a gasoline 5.4L V8 in it and i hooked up the jumper hit boost, barely turned it over twice.  Really really underwhelming, I have a Noco Genius charger and it's great, my buddy also has their biggest jumper and he loves it, so i was expecting this jumper to perform well, and it did not.

The first time the car (1999 Lexus RX that is not garaged and that I don’t drive very much) would not turn over but the lights flickered. The Noco turned it over on the first try. Let the car run for half an hour and it was fine. The second time about a week and a half later, same car, the battery was stone dead. Nothing when I turned the key. Tried the Noco first with the normal procedure and nothing happened. Then tired the boost feature. Nothing happened at first. Tried turning it off and adjusting the clamps a few times and let it sit for a bit. Was about to give up, tired one more time and then the panel flickered. I stopped, waited 30 seconds or so, tried again, and lo and behold it started. Ran the motor for 40 minutes and it turned off and on just fine. I think the trick with this thing is that you have to wait for a bit between tries. Instructions say not to try more than 5 times in 15 minutes. We’ll see what happens next time.

So I looked for the best jump starter and decided on this. I ordered the jumper, the charger and the case. All of them came in well sealed boxes - good presentation. But the case arrived in an gbc013 box and instead of being a gbc013 case inside it was a gbc015. I looked closer: the cases are identical so they may have switched the tags. Still the jumper would not fit in. So I'm thinking - if i will place my trust on an item with questionable country of origin and questionable quality controls, what is the difference from any other brand from that country? I might as well get a similar one with highest amperage and more listed capabilities. My advice: Don't set on a brand name. They are all mostly the same.",3

This was one of those times when the battery died at 2 am suddenly (taught me to take better care of that aspect with a vehicle with a touchy battery and for work to consider a new battery for the vehicle while the dealership is trying to hustle for money before the purchase), this product was small and light enough to fit in my cargo pocket.  It took me 12 minutes to get started from a completely dead battery; whereby 11 and a half of those minutes was spent diagnosing the problem, reading the vehicle's owner's manual, and finally locating the vehicle's battery in the darkness with limited lighting from street lights and a 9,000 lumen flashlight.

Decided to drive our old Ford Expedition up alongside it, to jump-start it. But the Ford battery was dead, too. So I bought the Noco GB40, because (i) it had good reviews and (ii) I liked the fact that it didn't have its own external (""brick-style"") charger, and instead charged via microUSB. It arrived the next day, so I immediately gave it a full charge, using a microUSB cable plugged into a USB hub on my computer. Then, out to the Mazda. Attached the cables, turned the device on. The indicator lights looked as expected. Went to the car - started first time. Unhooked the cables, and did the same to the Ford - with the same result. Much bigger battery, and engine - started on the first turn of the key.  The device still showed full charge.

As a result, I own three of of them, and I keep one in each vehicle I own. V-8's, V-6's, four-cylinders, motorcycles, and riding mowers, the GB-40 services them all without fail. Unlike similar jumpstarter, the GB40's components are almost entirely internal, except for the cables. There are no capacitors or anything to break or fracture on the cables themselves. All the lighted indicators and controls are on the the device itself. The build quality ruggedly excellent. The only negative is that carrying bag is flemsy and an aftermarket carrying case may have to be purchased for better organization and protection for the device and accessories.To compare, I purchased similarly priced jumpstarter from Costco, Type-S, I believe was the name. I attempted to jump a vehicle I routinely have to jumpstart in my yard with no success, plus the device indicated a fault after the first attempt. The Type-S had to be recharged or connected to a USB charger to clear the fault, and after a second attempt failed to start the vehicle.

I had just bought a NEW Battery. We installed it and drove around for a month. One Friday, we went to deliver food to people. We got home and unloaded our things and the trunk did not fully latch.
We stayed home all weekend.

We went to go out on Monday, and our New Battery was Dead.

I had this in my Amazon Cart. Amazon had told me that it worked with my car, I bought it, it was delivered in a few days, we charged it up.. and tried to read the tiny directions...LOL. {I had to find a way to enlarge them 200%}. .. then it was Super Easy! We JUMPED our Battery and Drove around to charge it.

HUGE NOTE!! They make other products, that work differently. Hubby watched a “How To Video For The Wrong One First, when he could not see the directions.” Once we figured that part out..LOL. It was LIFE CHANGING. {had to share, since we got a good laugh out of it.}

I will not leave home without it! You do not need JUMPER Cables or AAA. This is amazing. And it charges other devices! You can charge it in your car, or in your house. We bought the little plug thingy too. {I am super technical}

It has a great flash light! It has safety features! It is pretty easy, once you can read the instructions..or find the right “How To” video.

Though the Philips (previous Autoexpress winner) has a brighter hot spot, its range ( higher up on the wall) and width (can see much more of the trampoline) are limited.

I used the GB40 three times since I have purchased it  and every time I used it, it wasn't strong enough to turn over the motor. My first attempt was on my 2006 BMW M3. I thought I wasn't using correctly so I chocked it up to user error. After a proper battery jump using good old-fashioned jumper cables with a good Samaritan, I got home read through the manual again and reviewed some YouTube videos. At this point I thought I had a better understanding of how to use the battery pack which in retrospect, I was using the device correctly on my first attempt. Some time later, I used it again on my 2006 BMW M3; and again it was not strong enough to turn the motor over. Very frustrated, I got home by other means and again re-charged the battery and a month or two later needed the battery pack again, but this time for my wife's mini-van. A 2013 Chrysler Town & Country. And YET AGAIN, it failed to turn the motor over. But I knew better and also brought along some jumper cables. This last try was the straw that broke the camels back and had to write a review. I WOULD NOT recommend this battery pack to anyone. I know there are a lot of positive reviews of this device here online but they definitely do not fall in line with my experiences. Luck of the draw I guess. You results, as they say, will vary. Mine did. Good luck.",2
Osram 64193NB200 Night Breaker Laser 200 Halogen bulb,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2019-12-28,"For car owners/ enthusiasts who are just wading into the minefield of car headlights, I hope this review will shine some light 😉 on your long and confusing journey..

As a budget conscious motorist who loves his cars looking as great as can possibly be, I look on with envy when I see high end cars with lovely led headlights and daylight running lights. My little 2014 VW polo was not endowed with any of those pretty white headlights from the onset, so any time a headlamp blows out, I trawl the internet (well, mainly Amazon & Ebay 😊) in search of the best replacements I can get. Over the years, I have tried them all: blue, yellow, white, Phillips, Osrams... you-name-it. Some lasted a couple of months, whilst others came close to giving me a full year's service.

The best option is of course to change the whole lighting housings & systems to DLRs/ LEDs, which would set me back the best part of £500... so not an option.

The second best options seem to be led bulbs or HID conversion kits to be installed into the existing housing, both of which require quite a bit of wiring (or modification). Given the horror stories I've read on the heat-sinks for leds and the grey areas regarding their (& HID's) legality, I find myself, time and time again, condemned to the world of halogens.

My last set (Osram cool blue) may have looked pretty, but were extremely poor when it came to their primary function - lighting up the road ahead. Just to be clear, they are not blue at all, giving the silly look that can be found on boy-racers' cars... but give out a nice white light. However to me, ""pretty"" comes a distant second - after safety.. I need clear visibility as a priority.

Having read up quite a number of reviews, and having seen the lighting effects first hand, I have to conclude that when it comes to headlamp bulbs, ""ugly yellow"" will outdo halogen ""whites"" and ""blues"" on any day. And these ones seem to be ahead of the pack...

Happy Motoring!",10

Not too hard to install, but this varies from car to car; some being a two minute job with no tools, and some being a trip to the dealer to have the bumper loosened and entire headlight unit removed. Strange that Amazon ask for a rating for this.

I've used this in the past to charge a phone, and with the thoughts of perhaps jump starting one of many smaller cars my nieces drive, but never really my own. The light on this is very bright. The power is strong enough to cold crank a large truck battery. The one thing I've noticed is when charging it seems to charge better through my laptop than a USB type plug in.

Well, these second set have been in 6 months and already one of them has blown 😔 I still think they have great brightness but for the extra money they cost and the abysmally short life I cannot recommend them.
I will now look elsewhere for brighter than stock bulbs. But I won't be buying these again.

Second set I've put in. I love the brightness. I can now see what I'm hitting/missing at night. Better than the stock bulbs that came with the car.
As I said, second set, this due to the fact one of the original ones I purchased failed 9 months after fitting. Perhaps it was a faulty bulb of maybe the fact that brighter bulbs don't last as long.

Don’t let its small size fool you. This battery packs a lot of juice. When it arrived I charged it for a few hours and used it to jump my car. The trunk had been left open for several days by accident and the trunk light drained the battery.I have never jumped a car on my own before. I watched a simple 5 minute YouTube video for instructions on how to use this device and was able to easily jump start my car on the first try. After the jump it still had a lot of juice left in the battery. The bright lights and device charging feature will come in real handy for camping trips or emergencies. I also really like the safety features on the device. This is now a permanent addition to the household emergency kit.,1

They do seem whiter & brighter than the Ring ones, which were an improvement on the OEMs, the change from original to these must be very noticeable!

Can't speak for longevity as I've only just fitted them but happy with the performance & may purchase a pair for the main beam which are still OEM at the moment & much yellower than these.

Fitting was easy enough, I wore a pair of thin gloves to avoid touching the glass of the bulb with my bare hands.",1

If you want to have more brightness delivered by a regular H7 bulb you have to pay for this! In case of Osram Night Breaker (or Phillips - I've tried both brands and there is no much difference) you will get a really bright light but the bulb will last (on average) 9-12 (max) months.

The NOCO was extremely easy to use. Just charge it to full once you get it (~3-4 hours for me). Go to your car battery, connect positive and negative terminals and turn the NOCO on with the power button. In my case, the battery was too dead for the NOCO to detect and fortunately, there is an override button. With everything still connected, hold down the override button for 3 seconds and it started my completely dead battery. Afterwards, just don't forget to keep your car running for at least 30 minutes.

The build in light is functional but it seems a bit dim. I think in a pinch, it might be useful but don't expect to illuminate a large area with it.

The NOCO is also very small and easily stowable under my dash. Overall, I'd have to say, I'm happy with my purchase and the NOCO boost plus works exactly as advertised.",0

Osram 64193NB200 Night Breaker Laser 200 Halogen bulb,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-03-08,"I'd been feeling that the dipped beam on my BMW E46 3 was not as good as it could be, in fact at times seeming to be quite poor and with an ill-defined beam pattern, despite the lenses being clean and the reflectors in excellent condition.
So after reading various test reviews (Auto Express, Which, on car forums, etc) decided to try a pair of the Osram Night Breakers.

The difference was immediately noticeable - certainly against the white garage door. Brighter and with a clearer beam pattern. This was the same when on the road, there is a crisper 'whiter' light and it is getting directed to where it needs to be.
I'm very pleased with the improvement and feel that the price was very reasonable too.
Recommended.

Incidentally, the bulbs that came out were a decent Phillips brand, so not budget 'cheapies' and as they were still working have become spares.",0

Install tip. The bulb clips are separate each side so pull up and clip under the older for each side.. Fit new bulb to cbale plug DO NOT TOUGH THE BULB GLASS and fit snug in the lugs. Then remove clip wire for each side so it rests tightly on back of bulb. If it is loose beam will not be right.

Osram 64193NB200 Night Breaker Laser 200 Halogen bulb,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-01-28,"I installed these bulbs due to the work commute consisting of mostly pitch black, unlit lanes. I replaced the high and low beam bulbs. I always found the halogen bulb set up on the BMW 1 Series to be inadequate in terms of functionality and aesthetics (we want LED white dang it). Very tricky to change but easily done. These bulbs are definitely much more effective. Wouldn't say they were much less yellow but certainly brighter and farther reaching than the OE Bosch bulbs they replaced. These have genuinely exceeded expectations when driving through the aforementioned lanes without warranting use of the high beams however when used were much brighter. Don't expect to last long as performance bulbs usually don’t but hoping to have 6 months use. Images don't show much but the reflections show a big difference in brightness.",0

On my road trip I had jumped off a woman with a dead battery, I used it several times for my neighbors and on a friend with a dead battery at Wal-Mart. The other cool feature is that it’s a portable battery pack with a USB plug so that you can keep your devices charged. You can store this charged battery pack around for several months without worrying about it draining. This so much better than jumper cables that can get tangled up and it’s not always possible for cars to be within reach of the cables other and besides, who wants to bother a bunch of strangers hoping they can give you a jump?

I chose this particular product because I wanted the ability to jump vehicles with larger batteries or multiple vehicles with smaller batteries. I’d guess on a fully charged battery pack you can jump off at least 3 sedans.

The only issue I had was due to my own carelessness. When charging while driving, make sure that you don’t do anything to break the micro USB port. Mine fell on the floor board with the charging chord in it and caused it become loose and eventually it could not recharge at all. I will just be more careful next time.",1

Even from a completely dead battery the GB40 works well. There is a vert slight heasitation, but not bad. If i had to buy again i would get the next bigger charger just in case (especially in cold weather).

My only concern is the micro usb charging port. Those have a tendency to fail on many devices and in time it will probably be the weak point.. I only use this for occasional jump starts, so it should hold up for me, but if you plan on using this often then keep this in mind.

After i jump my van i top off the GB40 via usb port in my van. It only takes 20 minutes to fully recharge the GB40 from a jump..

I feel so much more comfort with my wife having one in her car so she doesn’t ever have to ask strangers in a parking lot for a jump if I wasn’t ever able to be there. For the money you can’t go wrong with one of these. I left my lights on all day to where my truck would just click when I turned the key. Even though it’s only rated for a 3.0L diesel (I’m sure that’s at a completely dead battery) it still cranked over the engine in my 6.7 diesel F250. I couldn’t believe it. This jump box definitely got me out of a pinch that day.",0

He jumped a Massey 65 diesel and had to reprime motor using the jump box for almost 20 minutes straight. It kept power. He also jumped a case diesel tractor and 3 vehicles. The power output was higher than the vehicle/tractor battery when charged. So far no swelling issues with jump box or power retention of jump box. He was impressed with the amount of power out of such a small device. He has not had to charge constantly to keep power up. So far it is really a success.,0

Connecting the GB40 showed a completely dead battery. Pushing the button to get the GB40 into bypass mode a couple of turns of the key and we were on our way again.

We used it to start the car the next morning when we went to the garage for a new battery.

With the GB40 sitting in the car over the next 4 months it started 3 other cars and has shown no sign of not being up to the task. After the last car it still showed 75% charge but I felt I should charge it again.

Admittedly none of the cars I have tried to start have been 6 liter V8s but it seems to cope well with 4 and 6 cylinders admirably, and it's not so much the fact that it can start cars that justifies owning it, as the convenience of not having to panic when you go out and turn the key and nothing happens.

Oh, and the ability to recharge the grand kids' tablets on a long journey is also a godsend.",0

"NOCO Boost Plus GB40 1000A 12V UltraSafe Portable Lithium Jump Starter, Car Battery Booster Pack, USB Powerbank, and Jump Leads for up to 6.0 Liter Petrol and 3.0 Liter Diesel Engines",Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-06-19,"I'm writing this to reassure anyone like me, who is hesitating because of the negative reviews. They are rubbish - it does work.

After many weeks sitting in the drive during lock down, my 2L diesel car would not start. The radio was working and the locks opened, but when I tried to stat the engine, the starter turned over slowly and then died completely. So the battery had enough power for the electrics, but not enough to start the engine.

Trying to arrange someone to come and jump start it would have been difficult with lock down and social distancing, so one of these starters seemed like the perfect product. I looked at various models and brands, but they all had negative reviews. The NOCO was the one which looked most professional, but I was again put off by the many reviewers saying it was useless, didn't work, and in one case saying the RAC were laughing at it for being Mickey Mouse. If I had been relying on the Amazon reviews, I wouldn't have bought it. But I was telling a colleague about my car being dead, and it turned out they had this model, and they were raving about it. So I took the chance and bought this one (GB40)

Well the negative reviewers are either lying, or didn't read the instructions.. It's not junk, it's not a toy, and it really works.

I plugged it in to the wall when it arrived, and it was fully charged in a few hours. I didn't have time to take the car out for a drive that evening, so I just unplugged it and stuck it back in the box it came in.

Next evening, I connected the cables to the car battery, still a bit unsure whether it would work. The instructions didn't really clarify what to expect, but it initially made a clicking noise and seemed to be trying to read the battery. However, from the instructions, I knew I would need to press the boost button, which I did (for the specified 3 seconds), and the white LED came on as detailed.

Got into the car, turned the key, and bingo. It started first time. And the charging lights showed it was still green.

It was great to be able to choose when I want to start the car up, instead of having to arrange a jump start with someone else. And given the situation with lockdown, it's nice to know I've got this on hand in case the same thing happens. I can see why my colleague was raving about it - you know how much of a hassle jump starting your own or someone else's car is...and this just makes the whole thing a doddle. And since it's so small, it feels a bit magic too!

So do not be put off by the negative reviews. It was so easy to use and worked so reliably, I can't see why anyone would claim it's useless. I can only assume they didn't read the instructions (a hefty three or four simple paragraphs).",75

Autoglym Super Resin Polish,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-06-01,"I'd had mixed results with SRP in the past, but hadn't realised this is because an old t-shirt wasn't an acceptable way to apply it.  This is where the sponge comes in that's in this kit, because it delivers an exceptionally even & smooth application of polish onto the paintwork, and helps to get a very fine polishing effect going as well.  After rubbing it off with the red microfibre, the paintwork is now mirror bright.  The kit is also good value for money and is much cheaper than trying to buy its contents individually.  A return to 5 star for SRP.",1

Autoglym Super Resin Polish,Auto,0,5.0,United States,2020-05-12,"I don't usually write more than a sentence if I review products at all, but this polish deserves more.The abridged version: for ease of application and excellent results you won't be disappointed. For those seeking more details, read on.Used on a 2011 white Subaru Outback after washing and clay mitt. I used an aged, inexpensive Wen polisher and a foam applicator for tight spots. Per directions I let the product dry. I applied to two sections then removed with a microfiber towel (Griots green ""spray on wash"" towel, worked very well). Autoglym SRP is probably the easiest product I have ever removed. Even with white product on a white car I missed very little with first wipe.I  had used a clay mitt for the first time and honestly was expecting a more dramatic result. I even tried a small section with a clay bar and the results were the same, a small improvement. Maybe the paint was in good condition. After I applied Autoglym the paint was crazy slick.  And the shine, when I looked at the doors I could see objects behind me like a mirror. My wife was very happy with the results (her vehicle).I can't stress enough how important ease of use is. If you are a hobbyist, products that are difficult to work with take the fun out and if you are a professional they cost time which equals money.I happened to use mostly a polisher but I don't think effort or results would be much affected by hand application.",3
Autoglym Super Resin Polish,Auto,0,5.0,United States,2020-02-21,"Used this product on a 14 year old motorcycle that has spent half it's life out in the elements.  Must say that it did a very nice job of cleaning up the paint.  Not very aggressive, but not so mild that it was difficult to clean.  Applied with a foam pad DA.  Worked as expected, and threw some meguiars paste wax on after to give it a fighting chance.",2
Autoglym Super Resin Polish,Auto,0,5.0,United States,2020-02-23,Left:no-wax; Right:after-one-coat-of-wax ... this is a 20 year old Jeep that has seen very little love. Pretty impressive.  Takes 5 minutes to apply a coat.,1
Autoglym Super Resin Polish,Auto,0,1.0,United States,2020-05-22,"I did not really expect much because the rooftop and front hood surfaces have been dulled from sun exposure and it made no improvement there. But the undamaged painted surfaces showed no improvement there either. I applied the product to the front doors, but not the rear doors, so that I could compare side by side. The treated doors look nice and has a good shine to them as other reviews note, but so do the untreated doors. Bottom line is that I could have simply washed and dried this car and would have been finished a couple hours sooner for the same look.",0

Thetford Porta Potti Portable Toilet,Auto,0,4.0,United Kingdom,2020-04-04,"I don't know what it is with Thetford toilets these days. I've had several over the past 20 years I've lived on a narrow boat and the flushers (whether pump or concertina) always stop working. I've only had this since 14th February and already the concertina flush is giving up. Now I know you can buy replacement flushers for these toilets. However, having bought one of each type over the years, I know how hard they are to replace and how expensive they are. Disappointed.",13
Thetford Porta Potti Portable Toilet,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-06-27,"We live in a house that doesn't have a toilet upstairs, and my MIL lives with us and it's too hard on her to get up at night, walk down the stairs, go to the far end of the house to use the loo.  So we bought her a portable potty.  The first one we bought only lasted about a year and then started leaking.  When I contacted the company, they took no responsibility for it.  I realised it was because those cheaper portable toilets are joined together with glue, and it's those glued seams that end up leaking.So, when I looked for a replacement, I wanted a toilet that wasn't going to end up with the same problem, I also didn't want to pay a lot of money either.  I found this one, and there are a few different models of this toilet, but in my search for a good toilet, I found this one was the best for the money.  It has a nice appearance, it's easy to flush, and also has a way of sanitzing the bowl as well.  The lid actually snaps down and emptying it is so much easier than the other one.  This one has an ""arm"" (a piece that moves out) so you can empty the contents without worrying about spilling it.  No one enjoys talking about toilets I suspect, but if you need one, this is as good a portable toilet as you will get for the money.",9

Thetford Porta Potti Portable Toilet,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-07-05,"335 model.

Nice little toilet, obviously quite a small capacity so may need emptying more.

Few things, if you use the pump too harshly it spills out the other side, that's the top tank water, not your bottom tank.

It's not the most comfy but I don't plan to sit on it any longer than I need to, and I'm 6ft 5 and it wasn't too low.

If you use Thetford liquids, try a local store rather than amazon, as you will find them cheaper. Blue Diamond however seems to be the cheapest around, and I worked out for a 10 litre tank you should prime it with about 33ml of blue toilet liquid and 1 litre of water, as they say 100ml for a 30 litre waste tank.

Overall, hopefully will fit in the car for our camping trip, alongside the kitchen sink and the rest of the stuff we decide is essential for our camping trips, so good little buy. Note 335 is v popular as good for festivals etc, so much more expensive than bigger versions.",5

There is a fill level indicator for the cassette but seem to go suddenly from green to red. I would recommend you empty the cassette before it is full simply because of the weight of the full tank. The flush pump works well though care needed as it is quite powerful if you are too enthusiastic with the pump it can wash over the edge of the bowl.",3

A good money saving tip is to use cheap biological laundry liquid (Lidl) in the waste tank instead of blue nasty and expensive chemicals. Works a treat!",5

It fits in front of the CH boiler next to the wash place. It is very discreet.  I  like the pumping cleanser system.

(I am 5ft 2"" now - I have shrunk)  I showed my special son how to empty and fill it just in case he has to do it on a regular basis anytime and he managed it no problem.

Osram 64193NB200 Night Breaker Laser 200 Halogen bulb,Auto,0,3.0,Canada,2020-01-21,"In my Toyota I always found the headlights to be rather lackluster at night so I had been through a few different types of bulbs in search of something better. Well after seeing these OSRAM bulbs come up on Amazon I figured I would give them a shot as they are cheaper than Sylvania Silverstar Ultra bulbs and similar equivalents from Philips or GE. Let me say, these are by far the brightest bulbs I have ever used in my halogen housings and although they are not a absolutely true white light, they are definitely closer to a pure white than most halogen bulbs ever get. In my housings these bulbs produce excellent down road visibility on the low beam with the only difference on the high beam being the amount of light illuminating the sides of the road.

I will say though, while these bulbs are bright, don't expect to get an extended lifespan out of them. I've been through 4 sets of these bulbs now and the lifespan has been getting worse. The previous set barely managed a year and the latest set (purchased in 2021) has been far worse with one bulbs low beam circuit failing after just 3 months.

Overall, with the ever decreasing lifespan of these bulbs, I can no longer recommend these. Yes they are bright but they simply aren't worth the asking price if I can't even expect a year out of them anymore.",8

Night vision is very important, and after buying many halogen bulbs these are the best in my opinion and are reasonably priced. Bluish bulbs may look good (a matter of taste) but they actually filter light and reduce output. Some ridiculously expensive ""custom"" bulbs are actually worse.

I cannot comment on longevity yet. As far as ease of installation, it is the same as any other H1 bulb.

I once tried fitting HID aftermarket bulbs in this motorcycle. The percieved light output was impressive, but the beam geometry was incorrect and could annoy or blind incoming drivers, as is often the case when the headlight was not specifically designed for HID bulbs. Went back to Osrams.

Perhaps one day there will be LED bulbs that will actually outperform halogens as drop-in replacements, but I am not convinced yet by what I see on the market.",1

Osram 64193NB200 Night Breaker Laser 200 Halogen bulb,Auto,0,4.0,Canada,2019-12-31,"I replaced a generic pair of bulbs I recently bought for $35. I then did a bit more research and these Osrams were listed as the brightest available. At $200 per pair, they are about 6X the cost, but I figured they would be worth it if they were a lot brighter. So I bought them.

After installing the first one I compared. I'd say the Osrams may look a bit brighter, but that could also be because the $35 pair were 6000K (slightly blue). But I could not notice a huge difference.

So, if the extra $165 is a lot to you, I'd stay with the cheaper generic (but maybe opt for a less blue color temperature). There won't be a huge difference in brightness and you'll be happy. If you care about a bit of extra brightness (possibly) and don't care about the extra $165, then sure - get these. They seem well made and in testing apparently are somewhat brighter. I'm just not sure I would notice the difference.",2

Osram 64193NB200 Night Breaker Laser 200 Halogen bulb,Auto,0,4.0,Canada,2020-01-19,So I have purchased and used the osram night breaker unlimited for years. And they are great lights. So when I seen this laser type I purchased them. Well i installed them and it was like i had super bright low beams which would be fine but these were supose to be high beams. The light coming out of the left head light was perfect but the light coming out of the right lens was painted down really early on road. I took out and reinstalled to make sure was in keeper properly and it was. I think I might have got a bad buld where the light burns in the wrong place in the bulb so my light is out of alignment. I like the ultimate  series bulbs much better even the one that has great alignment does not cast light like the ultimate series does,1

Osram 64193NB200 Night Breaker Laser 200 Halogen bulb,Auto,0,5.0,India,2020-02-25,I bought these as a replacement pair for my Skoda Laura L&K model. They are a marked improvement over the standard Xenon bulbs provided by Skoda (which are also of Osram make). Big difference in the intensity and coverage of the main beam on highways and it isn't very obtrusive to oncoming vehicles and pedestrians in the city. Worth the money spent and much cheaper than buying from Skoda.,5

"Pet Boot Liner Protector, 4 Layers Quilted Waterproof Machine Washable & Nonslip Backing with Bumper Flap Protection- for Cars, Trucks & SUVs",Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2019-12-19,"This is the second boot cover that we have bought for our Qashqai.  This is definitely better that the first one.  It is a firmer structure and doesn't shuffle about in the boot even with three dogs. There is a generous flap at the front to stop any scratches when the dogs get in and out.  Very easy to hoover as the dog hairs don't stick to it.  The clip fastenings for the headrests are adjustable so you can achieve a good fit, without the cover being dragged down.  Overall, a very good quality and easy- to- use boot cover.",32
"Pet Boot Liner Protector, 4 Layers Quilted Waterproof Machine Washable & Nonslip Backing with Bumper Flap Protection- for Cars, Trucks & SUVs",Auto,0,4.0,United Kingdom,2020-07-16,"Ordered to fit a landrover discovery boot, it's slightly smaller and the sides don't come all the way up to window level, however it does the job.Material good quality & keeps the boot cleaner than it would without!I would say that if they switched the velcro strips around on the side panels so that if the car boot is carpeted then you wouldnt need to use the sticky backed velcro strip, just a design tweak, I've folded them over, stuck them together so it sticks to the mat & car boot, only prob is one of the dogs likes the noise it creates when she pulls it off!!Doesn't have a gap to use the isofix if you're harnessing dogs up, but you can slide a tape fix through the bottom of the back corners and then velcro them back up.",11

It doesn’t! Not even close!! Done waste your money. Even the stick down Velcro isn’t sticky in fact my dogs have sticker slobber.. very disappointed as the quality is quite good.

Also considering it's universal fit, very pleased with how it fits the back of my Passat B6.  One comment (not a complaint) though, velcro stick on pads not necessarily in the right place for my car, but easily rectified by buying and adding more velcro in more suitable places.",5
"Pet Boot Liner Protector, 4 Layers Quilted Waterproof Machine Washable & Nonslip Backing with Bumper Flap Protection- for Cars, Trucks & SUVs",Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-05-15,"I went to Halfords a few days ago to but a boot liner. £40 later and it was absolutely useless!

Fits nicely to my boot and good quality, with a nice little pocket at the back and the flap over the bumper to protect it. The dogs highly approve too!",7

It fits my Honda Civic perfectly, covering the entirety of the boot.  The bumper flap is an excellent addition as it protects the bumper from scrapes when my dog jumps in and out!  The material can be wiped down easily making it a lot better than previous cloth boot covers I have owned which could only be cleaned properly by putting them in the washing machine.  The little pocket is also a nice feature - I've been using it for my dog's frisbee!  Overall, it is definitely worth spending a bit of money on a high quality protector like this.",0

The liner folds out to protect the boot from scratch marks. It arrived quickly and came in a really helpful carry case to keep it neat and has a pocket when folded out (helpful for leads and tennis balls). Really reasonably priced too. 10/10 would recommend to any pet owner.",0

The sticky velcro fasteners are slightly in the wrong place for my boot, but I adapted it. The flap to protect from claws as dogs jump in and out, could be a bit longer,  but serves its purpose.

I purchased this to protect the boot area of my new car from my sometimes dirty bikes and dogs. It fits nice and snug around the back and looks nice (way better than just throwing down an old blanket or something) The rubber backing is great and keeps the liner from slipping around. I wasn't too sure about this, given the price, but I didn't want to spend hundreds for a custom fit cover for the rear of the Jeep simply to protect the boot and keep the dog hair to a minimum. I was therefore pleasantly surprised to discover that the liner fits perfectly in the back of my car!",0

I must say this version is a lot better than my previous version. The material on the bottom stops the liner from slipping and keeps it rigid in the boot. The head rest straps means that you don't have to use velcro and the bumper pull out means that the car doesn't get moody or scratch.The material is easy to clean and waterproof. For the price you can't complain. Product arrived very quickly! Would buy again.,0

Thetford Porta Potti Portable Toilet,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-07-17,"I bought this for a post lockdown camping 3 night trip with the aim of not using any communal facilities
I've never used one before and found this very easy to set up, use and empty
We had the loo in one if the bedrooms in our large tent. It didn't smell at all, which I was surprised by.
Set up is as simple as putting the required dose of each chemical in the top and bottom tanks and topping up the measured amount of water. I filled it at home and transported it whole, then took it home again full up, with no leaks
Using it is easy, just do what u need to do, flush and open the hatch-i think for no2s its best to open the hatch first. We did use the recommended loo paper,but ive heard its OK to use the thin cheap stuff sparingly.
The full indicator worked well, we filled it after 2.5 days (2adults, 2 children) before it went red
Although its helpful to have a large capacity, the bottom part is very heavy when full. Emptying is very easy and not the horrid job you'd think it would be.
Its very tall and quite close to actual toilet size.
My only issue with this is that you need to push the piston flush really gently or the water can splash above the bowl rim and go between the seat and rim and drip out.
Its only clean flush water, but i was really worried that we had a leaky chemical loo in the tent so had to spend a while with a head torch on crawling around trying to figure out where the water was coming from (was very relieved when I figured it out!)
Overall I'd thoroughly recommend, and for the money I'm really impressed at what you get",4

Heavy duty made, it fit perfectly on my car. This product is thoughtfully designed and well made. I was looking for a boot cover that would fit my car. I saw different brand but it was way too small (and other brands cost way more than this). This fit perfectly for my car. My previous car was always covered in dog’s hair in the back because of my German Shepherd. Before picking up my new car I ordered this and it is awesome!

"Pet Boot Liner Protector, 4 Layers Quilted Waterproof Machine Washable & Nonslip Backing with Bumper Flap Protection- for Cars, Trucks & SUVs",Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-03-27,"This boot liner fits pretty well in my Honda CRV. The large boot space isn't completely square so it doesn't quite fit across the widest part, but the velcro stickers hold it in place ok. What I really like is that the fabric is fairly thick and stiff, so it doesn't ruck up easily when the dogs jump into the boot. The flap to protect the bumper and lip of the boot is a good idea - it covers most of the CRV bumper (the boot is very deep). There is a useful pocket on the back of the seat section, big enough for some poo bags and a small water bowl.I'm very pleased with this - and the dogs seem very happy too.",2

AlcoSense French NF Certified Breathalyzers for France - Breathalysers (Twin Pack),Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-02-23,"Not sure how to review this product. It is French NF certified which is why I chose it instead of multi use electronic alcohol detectors. Knowing what overseas officials can be like, it's best to take no chances when laws have to be complied with. I have not used it, and probably never will as I do not drive if I've had a drink. I already have two out of date ones from the same company, never been used for the same reason. By the same token, I cannot vouch for the accuracy, though the supporting paperwork indicates a very high level of accuracy. I have no reason to disbelieve these claims as a reputable company dare not mislead it's customers, and by doing so put them in a situation where they might get be committing a criminal act.",0
AlcoSense French NF Certified Breathalyzers for France - Breathalysers (Twin Pack),Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-03-06,"There is speculation online that the law requiring motorists to carry these kits whilst driving through France was scrapped completely from January 2020. Even before that, it was generally accepted that the law was not being enforced. We have driven through France, Belgium and Germany on numerous occasions and have never been asked to produce one. Our relationship with the laws of Europe however, might change significantly in the near future, so until I see official confirmation that this requirement has been removed I intend to carry one. When you consider the other kit you need to carry and the other costs of driving in Europe, saving £5 is not my highest priority.",3

However, I have researched this particular breathalyser and it comes out on top. Don’t get caught out! French cops are less forgiving than us Brit  boys and girls in blue,  and if you haven’t got the right kit with you then you’re in for a hard time. This is easy! Just obey the laws of the land.  When in Rome et cetera…",0
AlcoSense French NF Certified Breathalyzers for France - Breathalysers (Twin Pack),Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-01-20,"Our family are skiing during the February half-term and are travelling by car through France. We're always unsure whether it's a legal requirement to carry a breathalyser but have heard stories that the French police had a habit of stopping cars and fining the driver if they didn't have an NF certified breathalyser. Furthermore, for those that did, the police would make them use the breathalyser and then stop them again to see if they had a spare. Rumours, such as this, probably help perpetuate the sale of breathalysers but these have become a staple part of our kit each year. Each pack contains two breathalysers. The most recent pack (delivered in January 2020) had a use-by-date of October 2021, which meant they could be used again next year. However, I tend to pass them on to my oldest son so he can check his limit before driving home the morning after a party. Peace of mind at a very reasonable price.",1
AlcoSense French NF Certified Breathalyzers for France - Breathalysers (Twin Pack),Auto,0,4.0,United Kingdom,2020-07-21,"These breathalysers are almost twice the price of similar products on Amazon. However, they do have the distinct advantage of being NF certified which should keep our chums in the French gendarmerie happy if we are stopped...

At just £5, its not worth taking any risks and, these are so much cheaper than at the ferry terminals or your friendly local rip-off automotive retailer.

These ones are dated until May 2022 so will probably gather dust in the back of the glove box until then. At which point, I will bin these, buy some replacements and the whole saga will start again....

CTEK - Battery Charger with Automatic Temperature Compensation,Auto,0,1.0,United Kingdom,2020-04-17,"This is a sophisticated car/motorcycle battery charger / maintainer that is generally regarded as the best by many professional review sites. However it does have an Achilles heel in that the Mode select switch is very prone to failure leaving you unable to change the modes. I bought one of these many years ago and although fine at the start it eventually had the Mode switch failure just out of warranty. I bought a replacement because the warranty had been extended to 5 years. However the same thing has happened again. There seems to be little point in having the ""best"" charger when it fails. It is not just me having this problem, just Google Ctek Mode switch and there are a disturbingly large number of people having this problem. They can't all be Trolls or malicious people. Ctek do not appear to have addressed this problem and therefore I cannot recommend this device to anyone else.",56
CTEK - Battery Charger with Automatic Temperature Compensation,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-05-14,"I bought a CTEK MXS 7.0 charger from Amazon in March 2016 ( it's now May 2020). That's over 4 years.
It failed a couple of days a go with nothing lighting up.
Filled in the RMA PDF form from CTEK's website and emailed it off.
Got a reply after 2 days to say that they are sending me a new one and to recycle the old one. So, I don't even have to send the old one back.
I think that's a great Warranty service from CTEK.",12
CTEK - Battery Charger with Automatic Temperature Compensation,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-04-12,"These chargers, 3 in total bought in the last 10 days, all work well on first usage charging batteries to the claimed voltage and then holding the batteries at the claimed voltage. This was tested after the chargers reached level 7, with a voltmeter. They have only been operational over a short period of days, so the medium and long term performance is still to be proven. I will add to this review at a later date.  I now own 4 CTEK 5 chargers, 3 bought in the last 10 days as all three of my cars are doing very few miles , if any during, the Covid-19 lockdown. They have 4 batteries in total ( Mercedes sl500 having 2 batteries). I have previously owned this make and model charger for 7 years, see below for a really long term review on this item, bought from Amazon in 2013 and some of its potential limitations discovered over time. The first Ctek charger I own was bought 7 years ago and has been the long term charger / maintainer of the Merc’s Service battery.  I have recently had the suspicion that it was not actually charging to the specified voltage levels. Instead of charging up to 13.4 volts by stage 4 it was only charging to 12.5 volts. This is of course a 7 year old charger and well out of warranty. I also discovered a problem with the 7 year old Ctek 5 charger recently when using it to charge my BMW battery which had become seriously discharged. It refused to charge it as it read its level of discharge as being battery failure. I had to use a “dumb”charger (an ancient Halfords charger without any clever sensing systems) to get the battery to a voltage that was acceptable for the old Ctek 5 charger to operate, but even then after 24 hours of charging the battery the Ctek 5 was only holding the battery at 12.4 volts - only 75% of full charge I am told. A new CTEK 5 has since been hooked up to the BMW battery and over 24 hours brought the battery up to, and is holding it at the specified 13.4 + volts. So good news for the latest CTEK 5s, at least for now. Longer term performance is yet to be discovered.",2
CTEK - Battery Charger with Automatic Temperature Compensation,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-05-04,"I don't often give 5* reviews but I simply cannot fault this little unit. Easy to use,  just connect it up, plug it in, press a button until the right lights show and off it goes! It sorted out a flat 110ah AGM in just over a day, then it reconditioned it (I hope). Don't muck about with cheaper 1 amp Chinese stuff, life isn't long enough for 110ah @ 1 amp, this 5 amp European made unit will sort you out. I will strongly recommend the 2.5m extention leads, unless you're right next to a power socket the roughly 3m end-to-end just isn't enough. I pushed the car up to the garage door outside, unit inside, extention leads under the garage door. Recommended, I'd buy this again.",2
CTEK - Battery Charger with Automatic Temperature Compensation,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2019-12-07,"There seems to be a confusion about MXS 5.0 when it comes to charging flat/dead batteries. It depends on how ""dead"" your battery is.

MXS 5.0 is designed to charge battery that has at least 2 volts left.
If your battery is completely dead, i.e. shows less than 2 volts, you need to buy MXS 7.0 (or higher) which has a ""Supply mode"" and use that to charge it.
Alternatively, you can jump start a car, let alternator charge it to more than 2.0V and use MXS 5.0 take over from there. So, if you connect this charger to a battery and after two minutes the power light starts to flash, it means that the charger has switched to a stand by because it hasn't detected a battery.
If you are buying this because your battery is already flat get your multimeter out and measure its voltage, otherwise you might be disappointed.

I love this charger, I bought it because I tend to do shorter drives and in the winter my battery suffered because the alternator couldn't charge it sufficiently. Now I keep an eye on the voltage using a CTEK cigarette socket indicator and give battery a top up when it is running low, especially when temperatures are low. Low temperatures are really bad for the discharged battery. I expect this will extend battery's life. Also, I have a peace of mind that I will be able to start my car every time.
BTW, I have EFB start/stop battery and recommended program to use is ""normal"". Ctek manual say to use AGM mode for start/stop battery but that is not correct for EFB batteries (confirmed by CTEK).

UPDATE after 1 year
I use this charger regularly all year round, in the summer every couple of weeks. In the winter i use it every week, regardless of the battery state and I leave it connected for 2-3 days at the time, especially on during cold snaps. Desulphation is done automatically every time it is connected; this is good way to keep battery in a top condition. Once a year I use reconditioning mode to reverse stratification of the battery.
I would definitely recommend this charger to everybody, especially if you do short journeys or if you leave your car unused for periods of time. Car alternators are not a replacement for a smart battery charger, they simply charge the battery in the crudest way. CTEK in addition to charging also performs maintenance of the battery by desulphation and reconditioning.",2

CTEK - Battery Charger with Automatic Temperature Compensation,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-07-18,"I purchased this unit on the advice of a Neighbour, who has had one for years. I had a two year old battery in my car and during the Covid lockdown, I was unable to use my car. The battery lost three cells and I had to buy a new battery. That's when my Neighbour suggested one of these chargers. They are nice and small and fit easily under the closed and locked bonnet for constant charging. The first problem I encountered with this unit is the size of the ring connectors for permanent connection to the battery. I believe that they are 6mm rings and I had to purchase another connection cable with larger ring connectors. As this also works for motorcycles, I guess the 6mm ring size is perfect for one of those batteries. Another minor issue is the LED display. The first five LED's are nice and bright yellow, but the last two area very feint green which I could not see in daylight. Having said that, I would recommend this charger if you do not intend to use your vehicle very much as it can been left charging as long as necessary.",0
CTEK - Battery Charger with Automatic Temperature Compensation,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-07-02,"All of the positive reviews were correct, this is a fantastic charger! I had issues with the 3-month-old battery in my car, as I wasn’t really driving anywhere during lockdown... and I accidentally left my dashcam plugged in for over 2 days which drained the battery down to ~8v, so naturally the battery wasn’t too happy and was really struggling to start the car after a recharge with jump leads. So, after installing the spade connectors on the battery terminals, I plugged the charger in and left it to do its thing. After an entire day the charger had analysed the battery, reconditioned and fully charged it! At the moment it feels like a new battery again. I will connect the charger once or twice a week if needed moving forwards as well. Highly recommended!",0
CTEK - Battery Charger with Automatic Temperature Compensation,Auto,0,2.0,United Kingdom,2020-06-28,These are highly rated products and badged by major motor manufacturers.  It's well designed and great when it works but is woefully let down by a cheap 20p mode switch that fails over time.  You will find that on the rare occasion you do need it it will let you down.,4
CTEK - Battery Charger with Automatic Temperature Compensation,Auto,0,4.0,United Kingdom,2020-02-24,"The useful life of a car battery depends very much on how the vehicle is used. If you use the car on a daily basis for medium to long distance journeys, a charger like this should be unnecessary, as sufficient charging will be done by the vehicle alternator.  A charger is only required when the majority of journeys are short  (a few miles) or when the vehicle will be stored unused for a period of some months, or when the battery is on its last legs.Most of my journeys are only a few miles, and in winter months, the battery gradually became discharged. This was evident as difficult starting, especially on icy mornings. Regular use of the CTEK MXS 7.0 revived an 8 year old battery to a more reliable state, although a battery of this age will naturally show some loss of ampere-hour capacity and a reduction in Cold Cranking Amps,  and will likely require replacement soon. The advantage of the CTEK over 'dumb' chargers is that it is less likely to damage the battery through over-charging, and can safely be left connected for an indefinite period.My only criticism of a previous CTEK charger was that the push buttons became unreliable after a year or so, requiring disassembly of the unit and application of switch cleaner. I have not yet seen this problem with the  MXS 7.0 after two years of use, so I hope that better quality switches are now being fitted. Only time will tell.",0
CTEK - Battery Charger with Automatic Temperature Compensation,Auto,0,3.0,United Kingdom,2020-04-09,"I bought this in 2015, so I've had it a while. Quite early on the mode button stopped working and if you google it you'll see it's a common problem. Mine failed quite some time ago, maybe a year or so after purchase, but as it was luckily stuck in the ""car"" mode it didn't bother me too much and otherwise did the job. I haven't used it a great deal, maybe half a dozen times over the 5 years and it's always been kept in its sleeve indoors,  so I doubt much dust can have got in.Unfortunately I'm about to buy a motorbike so would like to have used ""bike"" mode. Unfortunately I just checked and I'm just outside the 5 year warranty,- I rather wish I'd replaced it earlier now! I'm not sure whether to risk buying it again.",0
CTEK - Battery Charger with Automatic Temperature Compensation,Auto,0,2.0,United Kingdom,2020-02-10,"It was good when it was working. Then after a year or so the error lamp used to light up. Initially I thought it was the battery. In fact, it was the battery. So a new one was put in. After that it was OK for a while and then it started misbehaving again which confirmed my suspicion that somehow the unit probably ruined the previous battery. To avoid a a repeat I got a newer MSX 7 unit which so far has been flawless. Meanwhile, I reached out to the manufacturer and they have sent a brand new replacement out which of course I have not used.Could have been just one off. Who knows!",1

CTEK - Battery Charger with Automatic Temperature Compensation,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-04-27,"This is a great battery charger for the generally uninformed/uninitiated.  Just connect it up, leave it and the various safety features will prevent it from damaging your battery.  My only gripes (from a dummy's point of view): the step by step instructions could lead you by the hand a little more.  E.g. Yes you can connect it to your battery without disconnecting your battery. Yes it does automatically go through the various phases without you having to change any settings.  Major tip:  If you have a Ford C Max, or any car where the battery is so inaccessible that you cannot reach both terminals, save yourself some grief and spend an extra tenner on the power outlet/cigar lighter connector.  Important to note that this must remain live when the ignition is switched off.  The product support by email was great... Eventually. :)",0

In other words you think you know what they are describing but I found myself reading and re-reading just to make sure. This matter could be easily rectified, and given that the C-Tek product has been around for a number of years would have thought this slight issue could have been sorted by now.

Normally try and get it switched on before 12 midday then unplug when it gets dark because I'm paranoid gypsies will do some devils work with the electrics if I left it overnight.I suspect a lot of people will need this during periods of long underused like what the work I'd currently enduring with the pandemic.,1

CTEK - Battery Charger with Automatic Temperature Compensation,Auto,0,4.0,United Kingdom,2020-01-02,I have a 70Ah leisure battery which is for a solar project.  This got neglected and over a period of about a year the battery was allowed to complete drain and it stopped taking any charge. There was a residual voltage of about 2v so not truly dead but very nearly.My first attempts with the CTEK were not fruitful and it repeatedly gave up on the battery at stage 4. However I persisted and eventually it made it past stage 4 and started charging.  I don't know what the capacity of the battery is at the moment but it is at least 10Ah and is in the right 13v range.  I regard the battery as rescued so the CTX has paid for itself and I have the ability to recondition other Pb cells.,0

I have a Honda Jazz which I lift the bonnet and charge with the crocodile clips and I have a Volkswagen T4 whose cigar lighter socket, remains active, all the time, with or without the key, so I charge that with the cigar lighter plug.  During the lock down, both vehicles have been either sitting around doing nothing or doing very short journeys.. I have used this charger several times on both to make sure that they are OK..

One thing, be careful not to use the vehicle you are charging. By that I mean, if you switch on the car electrics when it is being charged in situ, this extra current draw can confuse the charger 'cleverness' and I have found it go into an odd confused state and get hot. moral of the story, if you want to charge the battery in situ, just leave the ignition key somewhere else, and close all the doors.

CTEK - Battery Charger with Automatic Temperature Compensation,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-05-18,"Well wow. I had always heard about C-Tek chargers from various car enthusiasts I follow on YouTube. From what I understood before purchasing one was that they are a pretty tip top product. I can confirm exactly this. I thought I would have to buy a new motorcycle battery which lay unused for around 2 years. Anyone with experience would be convinced that after that length of time, that would be one properly dead battery. The reconditioning mode on this charger to my amazement has actually brought it back from the dead. I was genuinely astounded, it’s like new again comfortably putting out 12V and holding its charge. So after one use it has basically paid for itself. If you are after a charger with various modes inc. trickle charging and some kind of Jesus mode, look no further. It’s also very well made and just feels like a quality product. Extremely happy.",0

My car does a very low mileage - 2000 a year - so has suffered many a flat battery.

I had an older version of this ctek which worked well for 3 years but this version gives a much better view of progress as the battery re-fills.

The cable isn't very long so you need a power point fairly close by. Not sure if its ok to use an extension cable or not.

Previously had an AA trickle charger which wasn’t powerful enough to keep the battery charged once it got onto the “float” stage. Replaced with this Ctek which works perfectly - you literally just plug it in (I charge it via the cigarette lighter socket inside the car), and then it runs through its programs. I think it’s the “pulse” program at the end which runs intermittently which helps to stop the battery slowly discharging once the battery is fully charged after the initial cycle.

My overall view are that these are disappointing. Packaging is complex and visually appealing - gives you the sensation that the product is superior and high end. However, appearances can be deceiving.

Poor quality for the price. The bulbs although brighter than a standard halogen, give no real meaningful distance in spread or light flood on the road. Considering the lifetime of these bulbs is less than 1/3 of a standard halogen, the performance when it comes to lighting is under par.

Estimated usage is under 200 hours and when you have a vehicle that has always-on lights, that’s not long at all. My first bulb (purchased the 2 pack) failed in less than 50 hours. I also took all precautions installing, by wearing gloves and not getting skin oils on the bulb as this can decrease lifetime as well (Take note DIYers!)",21

Unlike other jumper boxes, the ""BOOST"" function will jump a completely dead battery that has near 0 electricity left. To use the BOOST functionality, connect as normal and turn on as normal, but to use BOOST just hit the ""!"" and it lights up like a Christmas tree. It will boost any completely dead battery.

My car's battery was very dead, to the point where the unit did not recognize the battery, so I had to use the manual override button.  Piece of cake -- hit the button and my car started right up.  Also worth noting that this was very easy to accomplish by just one person, whereas car-to-car jump starting is usually a multi-person operation, so very worthwhile to have this unit stashed in your vehicle charged up and ready to go.  The construction is solid, and the clamps are very strong.  Cables could be a bit longer, but every jump start unit seems to have short-ish cables.  They were long enough to connect the unit to my positive terminal and ground, and leave the main unit laying flat and stable atop the battery, so that I could leave it unattended to start the car.I read multiple reviews stating that the unit would not charge to 100% without connecting it to the cigarette lighter of a running vehicle to complete charging from 75% to 100%.  I was able to charge it fully by simply connecting it to my computer's USB for a couple of hours (using the provided connector) so if those reviews put you off choosing this unit, take them with a large grain of salt.",0

They have male and female slide on connectors that should allow for quick installation inline at the speaker.  Their execution is failed.  Two of my crimp connectors just fell off, plus two of the female connectors are made for a size much too small than a typical speaker uses.  So I had 4 connectors of 8 to fix or replace.

Lightweight and easy to use and understand the colours and what they represent.  However, I didn't realise that I couldn't use the product in my microwave as its a high powered over 1100 watt.  It does mention wattage but overlooked this part unfortunately so now I cant recharge it in my microwave.  I contacted manufacturer who were really helpful but advised not to use my microwave and to use my gas oven for 3 hrs to recharge or place on a radiator.  Hopefully the radiator will work!!  Disappointed that I couldn't use my microwave and think manufacturer should highlight this particular point highly in their comments when selling the product.",5

At the end of my shift my car windows are all fogged with vapour, I then close the door and leave over night , in the morning there is no condensation or vabour But it doesn’t get rid of the food smell , still great but ran the same test without the bag same result.

I use meguiers hot tyre shine with this sponge and the thing I like about it is when used with this product you don't use a lot, just three or four sprays on the sponge and that will coat your tyre enough without getting any on your wheels. Very easy to use and you'll probably get six or seven month out of it before you'll need to get a new. Recommended.",0

It starts of white in colour and this means you can use it to take in the moisture in your car so you can take less or no time to demist your car. You can use it in the microwave when the dot goes pink / red and when cool it turns white and you can re-use it in the car. If it is frosty, it will help on the inside and works really well. I have used all types of de-humidifier in my car including tubs that take in moisture but this is really well worth buying. I have on for the front and one for the back. With out it, you might find 10 mins to demist your car in winter but this will take less than 5 mins. When frost is on the car, it helps to clear your windscreen just as fast and stops frost from forming on the inside if you suffer from that too. Great item. Great value.",0

We use it in one of our cars that has a particularly bad condensation problem over winter, it really makes a difference. It acts like a sponge with moisture to draw it in so the windscreen stays dry.

Pingi Dehumidifier Car And Home LV-A300 - Absorbs Moisture Condensation Damp Keeping Windscreens Clear - One Reusable 299 g Bag,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-01-06,I bought this to deal with window condensation in my fiat coupe. It has completely cleared up the issue and im very pleased with the product. I would like to draw attention to the fact you need a microwave that you can change the wattage on as this needs to be microwaved at 600w .. a lot of conventional microwaves are around 800-900w and cant be changed. I would imagine this might be why other reviewers have had premature failure of the product. It is still quite wet on the surface after micro waving.. i give it an hour on a rad before returning to the car. Also the 'pink' it goes is quite subtle and looks white ... i let the fact my windows have misted up again dictate when I recharge.,0

LITTLE TREES Air Freshener,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-07-22,An early review that will be subject to change as necessary.This is for the Little Trees New Car fragrance 6-pack.  Had bought two replacement vehicles in February 2020 and placed a freebie car wash air freshener in each.  They lasted a long time but once spent I saw a good deal on Lemon Sherbert here - they were awful and the fragrance vanished too soon.The new car fragrance is the same as the car wash freebies and smells lovely!  Just hoping it last a reasonable amount of time this time.,0
LITTLE TREES Air Freshener,Auto,0,2.0,United Kingdom,2020-02-19,These little trees became completely different since they changed the company name. Doesn't smell as good as they used to do before and do not last more than few days. Just sad I have to go after different brand from now.,1

LITTLE TREES Air Freshener,Auto,0,3.0,United Kingdom,2020-05-23,Put one in the car and almost immediately couldn't smell much and couldn't detect a new car smell... Put in a second one straight away and not much better. Maybe the fragrance is very subtle but that's not what you want if you can't smell it even when you use two and you get in the car and you cannot detect it straight off.  Not buying again sorry.,0

Elsan Organic Toilet Fluid for Motorhomes 2 L - Green,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-04-08,"There are some Parks which do not normally let you empty / dump toilet waste or 'black water' at their sites through their normal 'grey water' channels (shower and sink waste water).  Always check with the site owner first, but this product, being organic, helps break down the black water / waste better, and being environmentally friendly, can sometimes be emptied into grey water systems, if the site owners' permit this.*** However, don't assume anything without asking permission ***  - despite this features - there are some sites who (quite rightly for them) will still insist that your toilet waste/ black water, even with the use of this product, is still emptied down the Chemical waste channels at all times - with no exceptions to this rule at any time.I regularly use this product in my RV and it also keeps the smells down too!",1

I have to say it is even better than some blue liquids, and the scent is the most pleasant I’ve come a ross so far.

In a PortaPotty, folowing the label’s dosage, we use 120ml in the holding tank and 30ml in the water reservoir. So total of 150ml for every change. You do the math.",0

Easily clicked the old ones out and clicked these in (shorter people may require a stool as it could be a bit of a stretch!). The 650mm wiper is slightly longer than the original wiper and provides ever so slightly better coverage. They are highly effective at shifting water without any smearing.

Meguiar's G15812EU Ultimate Black Plastic Restorer Trim Restorer 355ml,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-04-11,"Bought to restore /maintain car's finish on plastic areas and what an amazing difference.Upon application,  appearance improvement is instant and dramatic!  From dull & aged to sleeker than new on a 2007 model car.  13 years of elements and now,  at least my trim looks new.While I have a full cleaning kit from auto glym to get through, am slowly phasing it to Meguiar's.  Their glass polish is fantastic,  this plastic restorer is fantasic.  Tomorrow I'll be using their leather cleaner.Not a fan of their waterless wash though,  the finish was great, just very expense to wash a car!",3
Meguiar's G15812EU Ultimate Black Plastic Restorer Trim Restorer 355ml,Auto,0,3.0,United Kingdom,2020-03-14,"Tried many different products, all cost about the same, but this one seems to do what it says on the bottle and that is 'no streaks after rain' It has now been on the black bits of the car for three days and so far not one streak and we have had rain every night since applying it! Need to wait and see how long that continues to work but so far so good. Not the easiest product to put on I have to say, it's a white cream, as it does seem to take a fair amount of rubbing to get it into the black plastic trim around the wheel arches and sills, they have a heavy grain, but once it's on it looks good enough. As for the other black plastic trim! Well, the smooth bits accept this product easily and again no streaks so far so all good. It's worth a go for sure.",1

I am using it on several motorcycles and a Mini Cooper. There is a lot of black plastic trim on the mini and it has restored the colour to new and left a nice sheen. Not sure how long it will last but I have had it applied for a couple of weeks and with the loss of summer weather I have driven through some foul weather and it still looks great, all be it in need of a good wash now.Highly recommend this product.p.s. use sparingly, a little goes a long way.",0

Avoid this product at all costs people, I ended up using an old auto glym product that was congealed It was that old and still better than megulars!! It is beyond me how anyone can leave a positive review about this product. It only got one star as I had no choice! Otherwise it would have been a minus rating!!!🤬",3
Meguiar's G15812EU Ultimate Black Plastic Restorer Trim Restorer 355ml,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-06-29,"My ’05 Discovery was being let down by all the black trim – of which there’s plenty – gradually bleaching grey in the sun. This wouldn’t be so bad if the car wasn’t black – grey black trim against any colour doesn’t look bad, but greyed black on black is not a good combination.

A good swipe and rub-down with this stuff has transformed it. It looked vastly better after just several minutes, but several hours later it was blatantly obvious where I’d missed so I had to go back and do the job properly. Bumpers, mirrors, windscreen scuttle, side trims, wheel arches, boot trim, they all look so much better now.

A good large, soft and clean cloth is essential.",0

Meguiar's G15812EU Ultimate Black Plastic Restorer Trim Restorer 355ml,Auto,0,3.0,United Kingdom,2020-07-08,Ordered this to rejuvenate the trim on my 2007 VW Eos. I have mixed feelings on this product as you can instantly see changes as you begin to buff the liquid in the trim but it has a oily slippery finish which I’m not to fond of personally. I also used this for interior trim and the same results were achieved. There are definitely improvements when comparing it to what it was prior to application and does what it states on the bottle. I am not a fan of the finish and would consider an alternative product in the future. If you’re happy with an oily finish then this is the product for you I believe.,0

"Ring Automotive Ring RTC1000 12V Rapid Preset Digital, Air Compressor Pump, 2 min Tyre Inflation, LED Light, Carry Case, Valve Adaptors",Auto,0,4.0,United Kingdom,2020-08-01,"The pump is great, they've really thought about the features and ease of use: pre-set pressure with auto-stop; a long, wind-up power cord; built in light; large, clear display; big ""Start"" button; long, braided airline with a built-in deflator; a screw-on attachment instead of those flaky push-on things.

But oh dear, oh dear. That power plug...

The only explanation for sticking this monstrosity on the end of a wire is to physically prevent you from plugging it in. I've never seen a plug like it -- sprung (I use the word in the loosest sense) on one side only with a piece of rebar whose only job is to stop you from inserting it into the 12v socket. I pushed my socket through the centre console trying to put it in, so their design was a success. It’s the best electrical safety device ever.

When faced with silly engineering like this, there is only one thing to do -- take it to bits and hit it with hammers. The side “spring” is constrained by the casing so has no hope of moving more than a hair’s breadth. The end contact presses on the fuse which in turn presses on a piece of axel spring from an HGV. After an hour with a vice, a lump hammer, a MIG welder, cheap cider and plenty of ultra-violence I had tamed these immovable hunks of metal into something that had some give in them. Whereupon I plugged it in an found that I had bought something good.

Other than that, I've no real issues. Mine reads maybe 2 psi less than a calibrated gauge, but it's easy enough to set the target 2psi higher if that’s the case.

Overall, the Ring RTC1000 has got some great features; it’s quieter and much faster than pumps I’ve had in the past; and I really like the target pressure feature. But oh dear, that plug…",4

Initially I was very satisfied with the product as it work great, pumping up my tires very quickly. However, after the 5th use (I had a slow puncture) the unit would not read the tire pressure therefore would not pump it up. I ended up throwing it in the bin and buying another (different make)

The build quality of the product is good with some good features but not convinced buy long term usage. This is an expensive product and would have expected more than 5 uses from it.

"Ring Automotive Ring RTC1000 12V Rapid Preset Digital, Air Compressor Pump, 2 min Tyre Inflation, LED Light, Carry Case, Valve Adaptors",Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2019-12-30,"I bought this as I a) hated trips to the garage to put air in my tyres b) trying to find a garage with a working air pump c) to save money in the long term - I always ended up buying something to get 50p coins just to use the machines.

I keep it in my boot and it comes in a handy little case. It is relatively easy to setup and use, beware the extra bits in the packet as this can fall out of the carry case if you’re not careful especially at night if doing your tyres. It comes with loads of other connectors for bike tyres/football etc.

How to use:
You unwind the connector to connect to the cigarette lighter in the car, turn the yellow dial to the desired / psi / bar setting, connect the hose to your tyre, and then press the button. It can do a full flat tyre in 3 mins easily which is the best I have seen from a mobile unit.

The noise levels are relatively low as I issued to have one that could wake up three streets, it’s more gentle buzzing sound only audible from two houses either side of you. It has a handy little light which is useful in the dark trying to find your tyre connector.

Accuracy:
My experience is that it is relatively accurate, my only feedback here is when you’re trying to unscrew the connector from the tyre it allows air out of the tyre as you do it. I offset this by adding slightly more pressure from the start e.g. I need 2.2 bar so I add 2.25 bar of pressure instead and comes up perfect.

My reasons for this choice were that it was quite powerful, reported to be very accurate and was compact enough to fit behind my spare wheel out of sight and not obstructing anything.I like the wind up cable which plugs into a 12 volt socket rather than having to connect it directly to the battery which is needed with the RAC 900.The pump is quite rapid and I have checked its accuracy with a good quality pressure gauge and found it to be within 1psi which is good.My only slight criticism is the length of the power cable which Is short as it  has to fit on a winder. This means moving the plug to alternative sockets in the car or leading it out through different doors to reach all the wheels. Not a terribly big problem.Would highly recommend it and hope it lasts well.",0
"Ring Automotive Ring RTC1000 12V Rapid Preset Digital, Air Compressor Pump, 2 min Tyre Inflation, LED Light, Carry Case, Valve Adaptors",Auto,0,4.0,United Kingdom,2019-12-09,"bought this (RTC1000) as my last one from Halford cracked around the end valve you attach to the tyre (no longer air tight)

Was a bit hesitant at first as this was the screw type. But had no trouble attaching it to tyres with just the usual small loss of air that happens when attaching to any tyre. It's made of metal so am confident this won't crack like the last one.

Usual noise but can't complain as it is an air compressor. Easy to set the target pressure value and it also displays the actual tyre pressure. However when you start the pump the actual tyre pressure then seems to jump immeditaly to the desired setting so you can't see any inflation progress like my Halford one did but eventually it does stop and seems to indicate it reached the desired setting. (maybe the ommission of a progress indicates a faulty product and I should return it? which accounts for the 4 stars)

Yes the electric plug is odd because there is only the metal connector on one side and not on both, so you do lose that ""comfort"" double springyness and had to force it afterwhich it went in ok when retrying

So did all 4 tyres in a few minutes without much hassle and pleased wioth the results
(can't vouch for accuracy of the actual air pressure the tyres got but the car stopped telling me to check my tyres so must be ok)",0
"Ring Automotive Ring RTC1000 12V Rapid Preset Digital, Air Compressor Pump, 2 min Tyre Inflation, LED Light, Carry Case, Valve Adaptors",Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2019-12-04,"This RTC1000 mini tyre compressor is made out of strong plastics. The LED is large and very easy to read with 4 bits of information: the scale (PSI, BAR, kPA), the current pressure (at the top), a progress bar, and the target pressure you dial up using the yellow knob. To change the pressure scale, press the knob in and it will cycle through the 3 options.
The yellow light switch switches on a good bright LED light on the side of the unit that will illuminate your wheel at night.
The unit lays down flat, is stable and doesn't move.
Both leads are a good length. I didn't have any problems with the screw in adapter into the tyre valve. Just offer it up in line and it screws in with very little air escaping.

I had no problem with the 12V Adapter plug that is supplied and which many reviews have complained about. Rather than use a 12V supply from the car, I connect to a 240V / 12v mains converter that I bought from here :
https://www.amazon.co.uk/RoyPow-Converter-Transformer-200V-240V-Cigarette/dp/B07QTHWJR1/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=RoyPow+AC+to+DC+Converter+12V+Power+Adapter+Transformer+Supply+180W&qid=1575507392&s=electronics&sr=1-1
Its a nice tight fit and I have had no problems with it, in addition I don't have to start the car or even open the car to check the pressures.

It inflates really quickly and the cut-out seems to be consistant over 4 tyres.
It seems reasonable accurate when compared to a seperate digital tyre pressure gauge that I tested it against. The readings for 32.0 PSI on my digital gauge required the RTC1000 to go up to 32.5 PSI. However, I don't know which device provided the more accurate reading. If anyone has any suggestions about where I can calibrate it please let me know.

I have tested it against my car to 32 PSI and my bike to 65 PSI. Inflation was very quick and much quieter than my previous 30 year old compressor.",0

It does what is should do - inflates tyres quickly.  However, the auto cutoff function doesn't accurately inflate to the selected psi, and is consistently under.  For example, I want my tyres at 32 psi, and so set the inflator to that pressure.  It reads 32 when it cuts off, but immediately reads 30 psi thereafter.  It's easy to compensate by upping the psi to 34 which consistently gave me an actual pressure of 32psi, if that make any sense to anyone other than me.",1

I like the design of this, the retractable cord is a welcome feature as is the easy to use LCD display. It's a lot quieter than my old RAC630 too.

The only negative is the cigarette lighter adapter doesn't sit in all that well, I have a 2017 Kia Optima and it does fit but a couple of times I've had to push it back in again as it's doesn't hold itself fully in. Never had this with my last one.

To start with the connector to the car tyre valve is screwed on like a valve cap, so it is easy to apply and stays in place.  The desired pressure is 'dialed in' and off you go.  The unit stops when the tyre reaches the designated pressure in a similar way to many public compressors at filling stations.  Highly recommended.

This one pumps up the tyres quicker than using the one at the petrol station. I had a previous version of compressor that had a spring loaded power cord winding mechanism but I felt it was too fast and if it broke would be a problem.

All things considered, this is a worth upgrade.

Pros:
* Cable winding mechanism is much better than wrapping the cable around
* Controls for setting target pressure are much nicer - always had to press various combinations before
* Remembers the last-used unit (previous model would always start in PSI - my car's recommendations are printed in bar)
* Twist valve is an improvement over previous smaller design
* Holding location for valve cap

Cons:
* Gauge is less accurate. Previous model was comparable with my analog gauge, this one under-inflates. I've solved this by increasing the target pressure by 0.1 bar to compensate
* Plug is a little tricky to get into the 12v socket, but it still works fine

"Ring Automotive Ring RTC1000 12V Rapid Preset Digital, Air Compressor Pump, 2 min Tyre Inflation, LED Light, Carry Case, Valve Adaptors",Auto,0,3.0,United Kingdom,2020-01-02,The problem is that this device has to be screwed onto the tyre valve but cannot be unscrewed without losing air from the valve thus you'll need to overinflate with a view to losing air to get anywhere near the desired target. Apart from that it's quick and quiet. A better design would be to incorporate a shove on shove off type of fitting like they use in air pumps at garages and not the rather cumbersome screw off overkill type which cannot be loosened without air loss!,0

"Ring Automotive Ring RTC1000 12V Rapid Preset Digital, Air Compressor Pump, 2 min Tyre Inflation, LED Light, Carry Case, Valve Adaptors",Auto,0,4.0,United Kingdom,2020-05-15,"My old inflator was struggling, kept cutting out and really struggling to reach the higher pressures.  This inflator is more powerful, quieter, and rated for higher pressures than my old one.  It is neat and compact, 12v cable winds into the case, again, this is easier for storage than my old one and the air hose is also easy to store.  I all stores easily in its own  bag.  My only criticism, as mentioned by others, is the 12v plug.  It doesn't fit properly in any of the sockets in my car or caravan - not a fault of the sockets, my old inflator fitted properly.  The plug is of a strange design that I have never seen before, it doesn't insert far enough into the sockets to make contact unless some pressure is constantly applied (not practical), it does not grip and stay in the socket, as soon as you let go, it falls out.  This, however, is not insurmountable.  I had an adaptor with crocodile clips for direct connection to the battery and a deeper socket - this worked well.  I purchased a 2 meter 12v plug to 12v socket extension lead with a better plug that fits all of my sockets and into which the new inflator plug is a better fit.  This lead is also rated for, and fitted with a 15amp fuse, the same as the inflator.  I am overall very pleased with this product.  It is also worth mentioning that the service from the supplier was excellent, The parcel arrived a few days earlier than the forecast eta.",0

‎Meguiar's,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-04-12,"I used this for the first time on my Tesla model 3 in November. I really don't like washing cars, I know some people really get into it but I was looking for something that work make my life easier and protect the paint on the car from the salt and grime on the roads in winter. I have ceramic coated wheels before and have used the cheap Amazon ceramic coating on bikes but was not too keen on doing this for a new car.

The wax/ceramic seems to be a simpler half way solution than taking the risk of some wide boy ceramic coating your car for hundreds of pounds or trying out yourself and ruining everything. This is just as easy as washing your car.

Nearly 5 months later, the car just needs a bit of a hose down and the crud just falls off it. The water beads and seems to just fall off it as well.

I have now also done my van (used half a spray container) and the car users about a quarter.

Great product.",24
‎Meguiar's,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-04-29,"I don't usually write a review unless the product is over and above the blurb. This product is just that. I saw it advertised in the weekly Jaguar Spot Light email that I get from the Enthusiast Club. I thought my E Type and XK 140 were really shinny, that is, until I tried Meguiar's Hybrid Ceramic. It has left my cars with a deeper colour and a shine that is twice as good as my last polish. Hand on heart I can fully recommend this product. You will be over the moon with the results. Don't waist your money on anything less!",46
‎Meguiar's,Auto,0,4.0,United Kingdom,2019-12-15,Looking at some of the negative reviews and felt compelled to chip in. Firstly people are talking about wiping off? You spray an a washed car and powerwash off job done... And no it will not last as long as a traditional wax but who wants to go to all that hastle espacially in the winter. With the price dropping tp £13.60 as it has justnow I would suggest this is a good buy even if you wash the car once every couple of weeks during the winter and apply every time it beats any alternative hands down. Every time I use it it lookes like a freshly waxed car and many people have commented likewise. So my advice would be don't take on board the advice of someone who hasn't even read the instructions before leaving poor reviews.,8
‎Meguiar's,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2019-12-10,"I’m uncertain about how some of the people who have written these reviews have managed to get it wrong. I watched a youtube review which recommended applying it neat to a dry car as an initial coating. I did this & let it sit for a few minutes & then buffed it with a dry microfibre towel & it gave a decent enough finish (on my black MBZ & on my white Audi). Then I rinsed the car off & sprayed another coat & let that sit for a few minutes then jet washed it off & it gave a very impressive finish. Rain now beads even when the car hasn’t been washed for a while. It’s very hydrophobic & the car definitely stays cleaner & is easier to wash.Overall, I’m very impressed.I think on balance, Gtechniq C2 V3 is my favourite hydrophobic sealant but this is a close second.",7
‎Meguiar's,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-07-25,"Bought it just to touch up the car when it got a little dirty after 2-4 weeks since washing it.
Found it worked really nicely cleaning up the surface, very very easy and quick to do vs wax and other protection products.

It made the original paint slightly more shiny.
After it rained the water beeds up really nicely (see photos) and stayed really clean.
I know these ceramic products won’t stop it getting dirty when you’re driving in the wet but for sure this protects the paint from the elements if you got it parked in the open.
Very satisfied with the product and comes in a generous sized bottle!",3
‎Meguiar's,Auto,0,3.0,United Kingdom,2020-07-26,"I've been amateur detailing for about 20 years and was really excited to give this and Megs Ceramic quick detailer a go. Now my paint was in really good shape, really smooth, sealed with collinite with overlays of Megs quick wax. I followed the instructions on the ceramic spray wax exactly and its not smooth any more - its rough all over - shocking really. The first pass (following the instructions) resulted in a lot of residue which did not look good. So I went over with the ceramic quick detailer to bring back the shine - but it was still rough all over. Then it rained - the beading was terrible, non-existent. So I hit the car with the hose and sure enough the surface chemistry changed and it started beading and sheeting.  The shine is not bad (its not great) and it repels water pretty well but the rough surface is pretty disappointing. So I gave it 3 out of 5. Wouldn't bother again.",2
‎Meguiar's,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-01-07,"Very Important when you use this product that you spray on application when vehicle is WET. If this product is aapplied to a dry vehicle it is extremely time consuming and very hard to buff without a machine polisher. 4-6 sprays on bonnet and doors is adequate for good coverage as product goes a long way. Initial application work down in lines with microfiber cloth which obviously will get soaking wet, keep rinsing as you go along. Next stage DRY CLEAN microfiber towel buff/polish existing haze residue to a lovely shine. The Hydrophobic properties of this product I have found to be excellent, probably even better second application a week later. Very Pleased with this product.",2
‎Meguiar's,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2019-12-08,"Bought this in place of using hard wax and buff method for the cold winter when you want it done as quick as possible. Washed the car thoroughly and applied as directed on YouTube for first time,  this is spray on and wipe/dry off. After the first application its spray on rinse off. I was really pleasantly surprised by the gloss and beading. Great value given the lasting effect and ease of use.",4
‎Meguiar's,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-06-13,"I've seen this was reviewed by other detailers who sang it's praises and I must say, it's a doddle to use.

I applied it to 2 panels at a time and found it removed very easily as there is no set cure time.

Had the whole X3 coated and buffed up within 20mins which is pretty quick for a car of this size.

Great gloss, tight beads and great water sheeting, making the car look beau and easier to clean.

No idea on longevity at the moment as I like to apply differing waxes every now and then.",3
‎Meguiar's,Auto,0,4.0,United Kingdom,2020-03-03,"The results are ridiculously good when applied, getting it on is a joke. Followed the instructions to the letter and streaked everywhere. It is very tricky to apply. It's a very thick product. It was still hazy in places even after using a machine polisher after.From my experience, you need to snap squeeze the trigger across the side of a car. This will literally be enough. If you squeeze normally so that you can see blue droplets it'll take ages to rub in. It needs to be a mist at most. Now lightly wet an application pad and rub all over in a cross hatch pattern. Do the rest of the car and then buff off. Do not do in direct sunlight or on hit paint. Don't worry if after the 1st rain it doesn't look good, the 2nd rain wil make it look amazing. Too much product has been applied. 1 squirt bonnet, left side, right side, hatch, front bumper, rear bumper, left roof, right roof.",1
‎Meguiar's,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-05-09,"The instructions are clear, they just seem like they don’t make sense as the first application is different to subsequent applications.I have been slightly bitten by the bug of car detailing son use the ultimate wash and wax to 2 bucket wash the car.  After drying it I then gave it its 6 monthly clay bar, wax and used this spray on first application (spray on, wipe off and rinse). I then waited till later on in the evening and did a second coat where you spray on and rinse off.Now all I need to do is wash the car (The two bucket part) and then spray this on and rinse off when done.  The car looks great.  Water beading is good. The water just rolls off",1
‎Meguiar's,Auto,0,4.0,United Kingdom,2020-02-19,"Excellent wax, easy to apply, however I did not follow the instructions for the first (foundation) coat application, instead I checked out some of the you tube channels on how to apply the first coat.I did not expect it to last anywhere near the claimed durability, however it does last as long as a much more expensive paste wax, and is so easy to apply, and unbelievably easy to reapply. You do use very little of the product, i.e 2 sprays for a door and 4 or 5 sprays for the bonnet or the roof.I will be buying more of this, and have recommended it to friends and neighbours.",1
‎Meguiar's,Auto,0,4.0,United Kingdom,2020-02-13,"Good protection if you're in a hurry (and don't have money for proper ceramic coating)It's the best spray on wax I've used but doesn't last as long as they advertise. My car is not a daily either. I applied properly, with full prep the first time, i.e. clay bar and fallout remover etc.Very easy to apply though and the beading is some of the best I've seen! Can't replace a half day proper polish/wax with a DA ..but considering how quick this is to apply and how long it lasts for a spray wax you can't complain.I paid £13 for my last couple of bottles which is fair... But I don't think it's worth the £20 it can fluctuate to.",0
‎Meguiar's,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-07-11,I had my doubts about this product even after seeing several positive reviews and video. I have to say this stuff is really really good. Its easy to apply and does exactly what it says. I watched a lot of videos and do have to say less is more with this stuff. After applying the first time I couldn't really tell if it did anything and was slightly disappointed... until it rained! Water just jumped off the car along with any dirt that was there! It's been 2 months since applying and water still runs off the car so it does look like it will last for 3 months which is the suggested time to re-apply.,0
‎Meguiar's,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-04-27,"As long as you read the instructions its amazing product.  I did it this way to get best from product.  Wash car normally and rinse soap off.  Spray the product on the WET panel and wipe dry with plush towel.  Once car dry, low pressure jet rinse it all again and then dry again.  Water goes white as your rinsing.  Product is water activated so mine was all streaky to start with so learned hard way.  I paid £20 for a bottle which was ok price.  Gone up to £30 now which is abit steep during lockdown.",0
‎Meguiar's,Auto,0,4.0,United Kingdom,2020-03-29,Well in a way this product does have some water repellent properties but not as good as other products like HydrO2 which litrelly just spray on and jet off. This product leaves streaks doing the spray on method so the paint looks terrible.The only way to make this product work is spray on small sections but by but and needs buffing off straight away. So to do a whole car takes just as long as a normal wax. This is why I've only given 3 out of 5 as yes the product can work but there are many other products out there which do the same job and also a lot faster,0
‎Meguiar's,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-07-05,Good quality detailing product that works as described.  Good level of gloss (whilst not necessarily the best compared to other high-grade Si02 waxes/detailers) is produced that lasts a good number of weeks.  Best when layered to increase the longevity of the product.,1
‎Meguiar's,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-05-31,"Applies like a traditional wax, very smooth, I'd advise applying generously, while it might quickly evaporate and may appear ""invisible"" after applying, rest assured that the product is there and appears clear.

After buffing and testing, the beads are very good and the shine follows suit.

Overall, very impressive, I'd recommend using this with Meguiars' Cermaic Detailer to keep topping up the shine.",2
‎Meguiar's,Auto,0,4.0,United Kingdom,2020-06-16,"Arrived early. Good price. V easy to use. I washed and dried car. I polished it. The used this product as a top coat. The car shines. I don’t know how long it will last. But in rain today, water was beading nicely",2
‎Meguiar's,Auto,0,1.0,United Kingdom,2020-01-15,No idea about this product. The item was out of stock at the time. Tried one of the alternative products available.,3
‎Meguiar's,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-01-02,"Lazy mans wax. Finally, something I can spray on and wash off.

I’ve read many reviews online with people trying to buff this in and not following the instructions. I followed the instructions exactly and was really easy to apply (there is an official meguiars video online which was a good demonstration. A power washer works best.

First application took 40 mins as was taking my time. To up applications are 10/15 mins after washing car.

Water just runs off the car and has a great shine.",0
‎Meguiar's,Auto,0,2.0,United Kingdom,2019-12-19,"I use a lot of car shine products and find nearly all of them do what they say apart from the exaggerated times they are supposed to last before wearing off. I’m struggling to find a single positive about this product, needless to say it went in the bin.",1
‎Meguiar's,Auto,0,4.0,United Kingdom,2020-03-22,"Pretty good product, but a bit pricey for what it's supposed to achieve. There are other products available which will do the same thing. Be sure to spray as evenly as possible as the ceramic liquid will clog and not run off after rinsing. Also dry the car quickly. I also found that the ceramic seems to smear around the windows if not dried properly. This is all in my opinion.",0
‎Meguiar's,Auto,0,2.0,United Kingdom,2020-04-23,"It’s good, but it just feels like a gimmick aimed at water beading rather than anything else. Its effects don’t last long for a daily driven car and you’ll only get 4 treatments on a large car such as an Audi A6. Overall I’d say put the effort in and go with a premium Carnauba Wax, glossier finish and typically lasts longer if applied correctly.",0
‎Meguiar's,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-03-28,"Great product. Yes, first coat is your traditional spray on dry car (post properly cleaning) and then allowing to dry and buffing  off  and will take some time but after that it's just a quick spray post your same proper wash and blast off with hose or jet washer.  Have used on wifes new black car from new and you get great water beading in the rain and certainly repels light dust and dirt. You also dont get anywhere near the mark's from water spots as without the product. Had no problems on black paintwork. All in all you get a great shine and an easier time of waxing your car.",0
‎Meguiar's,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-05-21,"I used this after cleaning the car with a clay bar. Easy to use - just spray on and wipe off. It made the car very shiny. I have not yet driven with it in the rain (unbelievable weather we're having) so I can't comment on how well it beads and repels water. Also, ran out of car shampoo so haven't been able to wash the car since using it but my car shampoo should arrive today or tomorrow and then I'll wash the car and see how it holds up. For the money I paid it looks like good value and I am pretty sure it will do what it says on the tin.Pretty happy overall",0
‎Meguiar's,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-07-27,Use this all the time now! It’s one of the best hybrid waxes. Just spray it on when wet and wipe dry with a micro fibre cloth. The ceramic effect will last for a long time. The longest I haven’t cleaned my car was about a month and the beading effect was still strong even after that.,0
‎Meguiar's,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-04-24,"Love the end result and very easy to use. Not the cheapest option out there and doesn't last quite as long as I would have hoped but when it's THAT easy to put on, it's not a major deal.As with most treatments, the end result depends largely upon the preparation.",0
‎Meguiar's,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-02-25,Was dubious about this but tried it out. And it does a good job much easier to wax a car than conventional wax. Not used it on my good car yet tho just on the Astra. Went on well and still beading well after a few weeks even after the bad weather and driving the car through it everyday,0
‎Meguiar's,Auto,0,3.0,United Kingdom,2020-06-28,"This ceramic detailer is easy to apply and has a good depth of gloss, can't say anything re. long levity as it's only been applied, however, Meguiar's are a leading brand so i would be very surprised if it's anything less than an all round quality product.",0
‎Meguiar's,Auto,0,4.0,United Kingdom,2020-07-08,"Gives a good finish , I've only used it once so far on my black Mercedes but I am pleased with the results. it beads well for a couple of weeks.",1
‎Meguiar's,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-06-20,Great product makes the colour on my car pop not sure how long it will last but time will tell. Can’t wait for it to rain so I can see the beading.,1
‎Meguiar's,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-06-01,"Initial application is time consuming and long winded, specially on a black car, but once applied and 2nd coat on , it’s the best wax ever, car is gets dirty but washes off really easily, water dispersion/ beading is unbelievable.  Well worth it.  5*****.",0
‎Meguiar's,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-07-18,Great product you will be impressed if you haven't used Maguires before. Better than Autoglym rapid detailer.,1
‎Meguiar's,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-01-06,If you like water to bead of you car but don't have the time or energy to apply a paste wax then this is the stuff for you.Make sure you have some quality drying clothes and follow the instructions.I already had protection on my car so foundation layer wasnt required.  Make sure you don't over use it misting it on and then spread with jet washer.  Feels strange to do this but after watching a Meguiars video this actually activates the product.I hope we get the new hybrid detailer they are releasing in the UK soon.,0
‎Meguiar's,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-06-05,I was recommended this product by guy I know and after using it myself I must say I am very happy with the results.I can't be bothered buffing cars by hand so this is perfect for me.,0
‎Meguiar's,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-05-30,"Awesome product, got this last year to try as read good reviews and have to say I agree with them all. Easy to use and works extremely well, water beads off car easily and also leaves car with great shine I have found. Lasts long, even after not washing car much after last summer it still was working for months after. I have used 1 bottle in a year so definitely value for money.",0
‎Meguiar's,Auto,0,2.0,United Kingdom,2020-01-15,Beading only lasted 1 week.i followed the instructions perfectly.its very expensive the worst spray wax I've ever used for both protection and shine..there quick wax is ALOT shinier and beading lasts weeks....,0
‎Meguiar's,Auto,0,4.0,United Kingdom,2020-01-23,"Solid 4 star review. For £18 you would expect a better result. I followed the instructions and for the most part it has worked perfectly but some areas proved stubborn to get the hydrophobic effect! Still, I stand by my purchase, although it is very expensive!!!",0
‎Meguiar's,Auto,0,4.0,United Kingdom,2020-06-21,"Awesome product, easy to use. The water beading looks good meaning it works well. Reason for 4 stars is the bottle was cracked upon delivery and some product had leaked out. Simple bubble wrap would stop this!",0
‎Meguiar's,Auto,0,1.0,United Kingdom,2020-07-25,"A waste of money. Was really excited to use it but it literally dulled the shine off my car. I had clayed my car a month ago and it was super shiny and after I used this, it dulled the colour right now. My partner used it on his car too in case it was just 'me' and it did exactly the same thing.",0
‎Meguiar's,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-05-27,"Just started using this as a layer over Collonite as protection after each wash. If you follow the instruction videos it's very easy to use and requires little product to cover the whole car.The beading isn't quite as tight as the Collonite but I think this has better protection against dirt sticking, washing is much faster now, water just doesn't want to stay on the car!",0
‎Meguiar's,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-07-24,The ceramic waxes without doubt offer a tough excellent shine as part of your vehicle detailing. The paint feels like glass after use.,0
‎Meguiar's,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-07-22,"Really pleased with this polish. I’ve used it on all 3 of my cars now and though I can’t yet comment on longevity, it’s looking very good and still shedding water well.On the showing so far, I’ll definitely keep using it.",0
‎Meguiar's,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-04-06,This is very easy to apply. I have done the whole car twice then on my next wash did another time. Great shine and still got over half a bottle left.,0
‎Meguiar's,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-07-15,I found this was quick and easy to use and does what it says it will do. I think initially I applied too much but it worked anyway.,0
‎Meguiar's,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-02-21,Depth of shine gets better after each use. First application takes more effort but worth it. Dirt does not stick to car as easily subsequent washes are easier.,0
‎Meguiar's,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-07-08,"Spray on, rinse off. Not as good as a proper ceramic coat but if you wax and polish your car, this makes a decent top up wax.Picture added is 2 weeks after last wash and after 300 miles in wet weather. Still beading nicely in the rain.",0
‎Meguiar's,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-01-31,Excellent product very easy to use and it works!Highly recommended,1
‎Meguiar's,Auto,0,3.0,United Kingdom,2020-04-06,Not very impressed did exactly what it said to do on bottle not a very good finish so I tried DODO JUICE WHITE INSTEAD MUCH BETTER FINISH,0
‎Meguiar's,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-02-22,Great stuff. Expensive for wax. But so convenient! When used frugally lasts around 10 washes maybe more with a smaller car. Identical beading to a carnuba solid wax.,0
‎Meguiar's,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-01-05,Use sparingly and focus on “rinsing” the product off after spray applications (first one is a spray on and wipe off job). I use this on all my cars and while I’m not convinced of its paint protection properties I can say it makes cleaning the cars each week easier. I reckon a bottle last around 5 months for me.,0
‎Meguiar's,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-05-06,"This product is very easy to use. After washing your vehicle simply spray sparingly onto the panels whist they are still wet. Rinse off and dry with a microfibre towel. No polishing. Stunning results. Before using, I would recommend searching YouTube for a demonstration.",0
‎Meguiar's,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-02-25,Recommend a neat coating first. (Buffed uo with a cloth once dry) Followed by spray and rinse coat as indicated on container for best results,0
‎Meguiar's,Auto,0,2.0,United Kingdom,2020-07-23,When parcel was opened we found that the polish bottle was leaking all over the rest of the contents of another order enclosed (ie 2 × Solar Lights ),1
‎Meguiar's,Auto,0,1.0,United Kingdom,2020-05-22,Product is good but the packaging poor as the bottle was split and some of the wax had got into the packaging making it messy to unpack and had to put into a different container to avoid loosing it completely,0
‎Meguiar's,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-06-11,This stuff is brilliant although you can go through it pretty quickly its brilliant. After using it. About 3-4weeks later i cleaned the car and after just jet washing it every bit of dirt and bird poo came of straight away and looked like i had just cleaned the car.,0
‎Meguiar's,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-02-17,Its a very good polish with great shine and srong water repellant or beading. It is relatively easy to apply but can be streaky if applied too thick. I generally apply it when dry with a damp cloth. It last very well and i only reapply every 2 months.,0
‎Meguiar's,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2019-12-31,Brilliant - I cannot fault those stuff at all. Easy to use. Obviously it would be better if it could be cheaper. Lol,0
‎Meguiar's,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-03-21,"Great protection for the paintwork.  Easy to apply and polish off.  If you love your car, this is a must.",0
‎Meguiar's,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-07-10,"Absolutely fantastic stuff, since I’ve had my Fiesta ST I have struggled with a lot of products to get the mirrored gloss look of the paint work. With this stuff it was amazing. Would highly recommend and so easy to apply.",0
‎Meguiar's,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-04-12,Great product easy to use but I find its better to use as a spray wax once the car is dry as opposed to when wet.,0
‎Meguiar's,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-07-15,Looking forward to using this. Then I will be able to rate it more accurately.,0
‎Meguiar's,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-02-10,Easy to use as on the bottle,1
‎Meguiar's,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-07-02,"I have tried the hybrid ceramic detailer , Amazing product, worked really well even after waterless wash and wax and no previous ceramic coating, just spray , wipe out and see the magic, mirror shine and water beads like crazy.Always trust meguiar's products blindly.",0
‎Meguiar's,Auto,0,4.0,United Kingdom,2020-06-20,"Saves a lot of hard work.... don’t expect it to be as good as the true ceramic coatings, but then it’s a fraction of the price",0
‎Meguiar's,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2019-12-11,"Car looks great when finished, hard work when using on a dark paint finish. Fine on most other colours.",0

‎Meguiar's,Auto,0,4.0,United Kingdom,2020-05-13,"Don’t use too much! I think I got a bit spray happy and used about half a bottle but I think you only need to give it a light dusting.

‎Meguiar's,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2019-12-31,Excellent product for its water beading properties and seems pretty resilient so far.Application is super easy but removal(buffing) can be quite frustrating. Although supposedly re-application is supposed to be a lot easier.,0

Doesn’t get rid of deep cuts sadly but light ones buffed out easily. Beware after one or two washes some of the scuffs come back so you need to constantly re-coat until a good few layers are on.",1

I am not sure exactly how well it cuts the paintwork as I have not buffed it for a great deal of time but I can definitely say that it has hidden some of the deeper scratches which were down to the white undercoat. One added bonus I found is that the colour I purchased (black) is very good at rejuvenating black/grey plastic such as bumpers, trims and mirror housings. It is also a very good wax which has made an excellent job of the car. Very pleased!!!",0

WD-40 Specialist Motorbike,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-04-04,"Having watched most of other chain lubes I have used get flung all over the bike I was very pleased to see how little if any of the WD40 motorcycle chain lube came off. After application of the chain lube you have to wait 10 to 20 minutes for the product to get sticky. It attracted little dirt on the road and I have seen very little wear on the chain over the year I have been using it, very pleased indeed with the product. Came back for more.",4
WD-40 Specialist Motorbike,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-07-08,"Really does clean your Chain up nicely without any fuss.  This + Rag to scrub is all you need (and a rinse down afterwards).  My Chain gleams when I do this and it also cleans the cogs/sprocket etc just as good.  I always cover where I'm spraying with a bit of cardboard/cloth so the cleaner doesn't get sprayed where it shouldn't.  I highly recommend this and to be honest, all WD products.",1
WD-40 Specialist Motorbike,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-03-22,Great for cleaning the chain on a well used vfr800 that had lubricating wax on. Everything came clean very easily.I've also used it to clean oil and grease off a few other things so it's proving to be a useful addition to the garage.I put 5 stars for longevity despite only having it a few weeks. Can't see how it would ever go off.,1
‎Meguiar's,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-03-04,"I've used multiple coating like this.
When i first used it I thought it was ok but not brilliant.

But the second time I used it I soaked a damp cloth in this product and sprayed it over the car.
It left a thick film evenly over the car and water was beading off nicely.

I then used my pressure washer to remove the product. It took a while to get it all off though.
The water beading is now a lot better than just spraying the product on and rinsing off.",0
‎Meguiar's,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2019-12-07,"Lets address some of the negative comments first who state it doesnt work. I thought the same at first BUT,  I have a black car and after the initial application spraying it on a wet surface before spreading it by hand then buffing off which is recomended as a base coat, it did leave traces of the product and didnt bead water at all! After some research on youtube I then wet the car again, sprayed a light layer over the top then rinse with a jet wash and dried the car with a microfibre drying towl - it works great with no residue and beads like mad... It actually works. Bear in mind any wax needs a good base so using any product on poor quility paint isnt going to work well so prep the paint properly and it will work.",0
‎Meguiar's,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-07-26,"First mistake I made with this was not buffing my car enough after I’d applied the spray coating. This left streaks on the windows and paint.
However this buffed our really easily and the following day there was rain and you could really clearly see how well the water beaded off the car.

I done the front, bonnet and front wings. I then jet washed rinsed 2 sprays on the bonnet and went round each panal 2 sprays until I got to bonnet and done that again as the cloth first time was dry. I then jet washed it off rinsed it off again ""didn't seem to bead a lot"" and dryed car.... O.M.G shiny. Next day polished window screen so cleaned car again, the water on the bonnet beaded just great any way I thought I'd use a wax application pad to use Maguire's hybrid, ceramic, wax. As I would put a quick wax on but on a wet car. Dryed it as I went on each panal, 'Eyes pop out' I didn't think it could get it any shinier but it did. Very impressed. I even done a car that's never been washed in 2 years not looked after what so ever and it done wonders wash rinse spray quick wipe to spread it evenly using little as possible. If you love your car this is a must.. I use it as I dry the car now it's an absolute pleasure washing the car now this make it easy and worth the effort. Literally 30 mins and the out sides done.

‎Meguiar's,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-04-09,"I'm fairly new to car detailing and the vast array of products on the market. However, Meguiar's products are great quality and easy to use, and I have several of their products in my cleaning arsenal.

This Hybrid Ceramic Wax spray is very easy to use: Clean your car in the usual way, rinse clean then spray the Hybrid Ceramic Wax spray all over the car - then, with a strong stream of water, rinse off from top to bottom, which spreads the wax coating over the car. Dry off with a microfibre cloth and watch it shine!

I've used this on both our Audi TT and Mercedes SLK, which have metallic paint, and it gives a great protective finish, allowing water to bead and run off effectively.
Expect to use around a quarter of one spray bottle per wash.

Highly recommended as part of your cleaning collection and regular washing routine.",2

So, check which product is being reviewed.I've yet to use the DETAILER, but I'm excited to to try it, following a couple of reviews I've seen on YouTube.

Autoglym Rapid Aqua Wax Complete Kit,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-01-23,"Smells fantastic. Quick to apply. Great results.

Totally agree that it’s on the expensive side and to be honest you can achieve very similar results with the turtle wax aqua sealant for nearly a third of the price.

However, I always find myself returning to this product. I seem to spray less on, it’s less streaky when applied and the bubblegum smell gives you that last energy and momentum when your arms becoming tired.

This needs to be applied when the car is wet. My usual routine is:
Pre wash snow foam and rinse
Shampoo with 2 bucket method
Finally I rinse the car lightly of suds and apply the aqua wax spraying on, waiting around 30 seconds and then working into one panel at a time.

Finally the best bit - The beading. When it rains the water simply beads up and runs off the car and looks really cool (as far as rain goes).",35

Autoglym Rapid Aqua Wax Complete Kit,Auto,0,3.0,United Kingdom,2019-12-05,"Ok. First the smell. Lovely. Very tropical. The smell lingers in the drying towel for months.
The product produces a nice glossy finish, far superior to other drying aids.

However, the product is flawed and the microfibre towels are only average quality. You are pretty much dry buffing the panels to remove the residue and risking a load of clearcoat scratches. Whilst this might be okay on a silver or white car, it can cause clearcoat scratches on dark paint, depending on the type of microfibre being used.

Use it on an old car with flawed, uncorrected paint. Don't use it on your brand new metallic black pride & joy.",3

RainX Rain Repellant,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-02-21,"Okay, so i have been using this product for about 4 months now and have got got to say that it works tremendously well. the water beads off the car to where you dont need the wipers at all!

i like to put 1 coat on and keep it moving so it does not dry like a liquid,, but i will apply and keep it moving until it hazes up. i leave for 10 mins then buff off and then do another coat just to make sure i get maximum effect. i also recommend this if you are applying for the first time.

also if you apply for the first time i recommend deep cleaning the windscreen using screen cleaner and then using a clay bar to remove any stuck on tar that could damage the wiper blades. and i also recommend buying a brand new decent set of wiper blades for your particular car.

if you do all of this, driving in the rain will never be the same for you again i promise! also another little trick i use is to apply the Rainx to the wiper blade rubber to keep it clean. i do this at reapplication and i re apply to the windscreen once a month. so it does last about a month depending on usage. i also re clean my windscreen and as i said clean the blades with the Rainx and this works very well for me and keeps your blades lasting longer and keeps them cleaner to prevent smearing and squeaking.

i also apply to the wing mirrors and the side windows to ensure i have maximum visibility in the rain and it works great! keeps the wing mirrors and windows much cleaner as the dirty water beads straight off the car. applying to the windows and wing mirrors lasts alot longer, i would say 2 months because it does not have wiper blades rubbing on it so it lasts longer.

my only regret is that i wish i knew about this product sooner because it is simply that good.

if i was to guess i would say you could make a bottle last 2 years if you apply every month and apply 2 coats. not bad for a fiver and for a product that really works very well!

i think people have issues with smearing because they have not cleaned their windscreen wipers or not changed them out for a long time. trust me its worth buying brand new wipers and deep cleaning the windscreen with a clay bar for brilliant results!

if you are driving over 40mph you dont need wipers at all! no matter how hard it is raining.

great product and i will be buying again, i must admit i never gave rain visibility much thought until i had a new set of wipers and this product, i will never neglect my visibility system again!",21
Autoglym Rapid Aqua Wax Complete Kit,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-01-04,Easy to use once you've washed the car spray it on wet and then wax off nice finish..,0
RainX Rain Repellant,Auto,0,2.0,United Kingdom,2020-02-09,"Very undecided about this product. Once applied you have to keep using it cause you're never going to remove the greasy streaks it leaves behind.

I've used it on my car and it works wonders but I have to apply more every 3 days because it starts to leave rain smeared on the screen and I can only use water in my washer bottle because if you have any detergent in there it won't last long at all.

After applying it to my wife's car it was awful from the start I may as well have thrown vegetable oil all over the screen and trying to remove the stuff has taken months of various glass cleaners, sweat, tears and copious amounts of obscenities and it's still not quite right. I think the only way to remove the stuff is with a flame thrower or a grinder! So will you use it? 50/50 you decide your fate.",2
RainX Rain Repellant,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-05-21,"I've been using this stuff for years and it really works well. I use on both my car and my house windows.The trick is to follow the instructions. Too many people just wipe it on and then buff it off and expect it to work, unfortunately it's not as easy as that.When applying it you need to work it in in small circles then leave it for at least an hour, then buff it right up. It's hard work but the benefits are worth it - and think of the calories your burning!",2
RainX Rain Repellant,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-02-27,"The best water repellent not only on the market but indeed in the world. There are loads of videos floating about on the interweb about how to apply this so try all ways you want until you find something that works for you. But I find that some fine grade steel wool over the windscreen to help take any imperfections of dirty off the glass and then wash down the glass with a decent wash wax. I use Maguires. I then dry it of fully but they run a damp cloth across the screen and then put lashings of this repellent on a cloth and rub it in firmly. Let it dry and then put some more on. When its dry I wipe over with a less damp, damp cloth until it doesn't show on the screen again. Also I dont use because I dont need to use my wipers even at 30 mph because that rubs it back off. But you need to keep your screen clean on a regular basis because natural dirt build up on the screen will impare it for when it rains and make the repellent less effective.",2
RainX Rain Repellant,Auto,0,3.0,United Kingdom,2020-03-21,"I read all the reviews and though I would give this a try on our windows and the glass lenses on some of our security cameras (I did try the 'plastic' version of this on the other security cameras with the same disappointing results), but I was really disappointed to be honest, especially as it is not a cheap product.
The theory is good, and it is fairly easy to apply but basically is does not work as advertised, for me anyway !

Rain did NOT just trickle off the lenses or windows at all, in fact it was only slightly better than having non on at all.
In the end I found using cheap washing up liquid gave better results.
Maybe for other uses and in different circumstances it does work, but for use on security cameras it is totally useless.",1

RainX Rain Repellant,Auto,0,1.0,United Kingdom,2019-12-11,"This is possibly the worst thing I have ever put on my car, windscreen cleaned with mentholated spirit, dried and Rainx applied as per instructions, now the outside of the screen smears with every wipe of the blades (blades cleaned thoroughly as well). It looks like fogging on the outside, it takes longer to go anywhere having to wait for the screen to clear and if it rains whilst out using the wipers makes things worse, have tried to clean it off, but it is proving stubborn.",6
RainX Rain Repellant,Auto,0,4.0,United Kingdom,2020-01-01,This works well. My car suffers from terrible condensation on the inside and I really struggle to clear the windows in the winter. Since applying to my windows I have seen a big difference in the cold weather. Hardly any frost on the windows vomited to most cars. I also used this on the inside of my window which has stopped almost all condensation it since applying I do find my windows get dirty quickly on the inside. When applying the stuff to the windows I did find you need to really the buff the windows up to make it work and can be hard work to buff out.. you also need to make sure your windows are crystal clean before applying. I have been using this for a month now with no need to reapply so far.,1
RainX Rain Repellant,Auto,0,3.0,United Kingdom,2020-06-27,"Returned this. Sorry can’t comment on the quality of the product.

My wife ordered this in her search to keep our regular windows free from rain marks and dirt - without reading the listing text properly or getting through reviews. Although I must say the instructions and text do not suggest this is exclusively for car windscreens.

We have large sections of the house with large glass window frames that are very hard to reach for window cleaners. So she was looking for a treatment to keep the windows clearness.
After having received it and reading the instructions, I dare not to use and apply it. Especially in the higher up windows that even the window cleaners are loath to reach it will be very hard not the let the fluid get in contact with the painted surface of the window frame. And I’m just afraid it will do more damage than good. Also I wonder whether it can be removed easily when the result is not as expected.",0

There is a bit of an issue with light misty rain as its not heavy enough to fall off the windscreen and so can block the view a bit but wiperes fix that.It works so well in medium rain I don't have my wipers on.Some times if there is a greasy spray the wipers end up smearing it across the whole windscreen and it fails to run off, as it would without rain x but its not always a problem",1

RainX Rain Repellant,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-01-14,I can't recommend this highly enough. I travel a lot on motorways and dual carriageways and spray from other vehicles when its raining as well can make visibility a problem. This is very effective at 'beading' the water drops so they travel up the windscreen and don't obscure vision. The heavier the rain and spray the more effective it is. I barely use my wipers sometimes. Note this doesn't work so well at slow speeds around a busy town but still is small improvement over not having it. Overall brilliant!,0
RainX Rain Repellant,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-01-10,"This is an excellent product. I have an old car and the inside of my windscreen would often mist, there would be a fair bit of liquid and it would take forever to clear.

RainX Rain Repellant,Auto,0,4.0,United Kingdom,2020-01-25,I’ve had the product on the screen for a week and it does seem to cause rain to create droplets that are pushed off the glass during motorway driving and the side glass stays clear.

RainX Rain Repellant,Auto,0,4.0,United Kingdom,2020-01-11,Product works well to displace water from windscreen with no issues of smearing or wiper judder but found exactly same product and same size bottle ( 200 ml ) for only £3 in my local ASDA in car accessory  department . So is VERY over priced from seller.,0
RainX Rain Repellant,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-07-13,I started by applying the spray on my show worked really well. But when limescale built up i used squeegee to remove it and then had to re-apply. Use soft cloth and the water repellant property works great again!,0
RainX Rain Repellant,Auto,0,4.0,United Kingdom,2019-12-11,This rain x is OK but was expected it to be a bit better than this. Seems to clean the screen very well but when raining and cold the wipers still leave a kind of haze of water on the screen. But seems to be better when the engine has warmed up. Would buy again but maybe as the washer bottle mix instead.,0
RainX Rain Repellant,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2019-12-14,This is a good water repellent when going at a higher speed(30+) lower is also good too but little drops of water seems to stay when driving slower. I have had if for a few days days now not sure how long it will last .,0

RainX Rain Repellant,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-02-03,Brilliant for repelling rain and keeps light frost at bay but after a few heavy down pours or deep frost it needs to be re- applied.

RainX Rain Repellant,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-03-22,This is a great product but you need to prepare the surface before application. I spent a few hard earned quid on a new bathroom including shower unit. My wife was worried about keeping the glass clean however she was astonished how good this works. Just put a bit of effort in application and you will be rewarded. Water and soapy water pings off the glass surface. Nice product and will purchase again.,0
RainX Rain Repellant,Auto,0,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-02-23,"For the price and to also compare to more expensive items, its an actual wonder why you would go for something 2,3,4 times the price.
