Snap Circuits Beginner Electronics Discovery Kit (Multi-Color),Electronics,25.99,5.0,Canada,2020-01-17,This was suggested as STEM gift for a 5-year old but the family of a 4-year old who enjoyed it immensely. It was well received and the kid's younger siblings loved watching and helping put it together.,0
Snap Circuits Beginner Electronics Discovery Kit (Multi-Color),Electronics,25.99,5.0,Canada,2020-01-02,Enjoyed by 7 year old,0
Snap Circuits Beginner Electronics Discovery Kit (Multi-Color),Electronics,25.99,5.0,Canada,2020-05-13,Gave this as a gift to a very bright 7 year old and he absolutely loved it! Got through all the set ups quickly but got a lot of enjoyment out of it,0
Snap Circuits Beginner Electronics Discovery Kit (Multi-Color),Electronics,25.99,3.0,United States,2020-05-11,"My daughter Loved this!! She is 4.5 and I am using it to explain what electricity is, how is works, and what it is used for. Its a great and engageing way to explain electronics in a basic, hands on way.

A few things to mention here:

The instructions are exactly that... instructions. They show what to do, much like a Lego booklet. For $30, It would have been nice to have some kind of explanation of what exactly each lesson or project is expressing. Because I am able to explain it to her, its not that big of a deal to me, but explanations should be given since this is a teaching aid! Especially for users who are completely new and interested in electronics. Be informed... this is not an explanatory teaching aid, some knowledge or guidance is required for the user to know what the project is having them build.

The battery cover... irritating. There is no reason why the cover could not have been implemented in some form other than near micro screws. Overkill or lacking in design. For the price, a cheap micro screwdriver could have been thrown in.

On a positive note, I found this set to be engaging, and fun to use. My daughter especially like the lights on the motor, and was able to explain back to me how the circuit worked.",3
Snap Circuits Beginner Electronics Discovery Kit (Multi-Color),Electronics,25.99,5.0,United States,2020-01-30,"I got this for my nephew for Christmas and it was his favorite gift! He absolutely loved it and after we built a few circuits together, he did them all on his own (age 6 btw). The instructions are very clear and it's quite durable. The instructions direct one not to short the terminals on the battery pack as it will cause the on-board fuse to blow. My nephew did this a few times inadvertently but the fuse never blew, so that was reassuring. I suggest that the manufacturer install a breaker switch or a fuse that can be easily replaced if it does blow (the current fuse is a hard solder through-hole part that can't be easily accessed).

I didn't have any issues with the components not working out of the box. I checked every component with a DMM and they all checked out.

This kit doesn't go into any circuit theory (a little bit would be nice) but it is definitely an attention grabber and fun as heck for the kids. I will be buying the next model up for my nephew!",1
Snap Circuits Beginner Electronics Discovery Kit (Multi-Color),Electronics,25.99,5.0,United States,2020-05-03,"I had this kit sent directly to my son for his almost-7-year-old son. I also sent a larger kit for his 10-year-old son. They opened the kits soon after delivery.  My son just called to tell me that both kits are a huge hit. The boys immediately dived into the projects and have already done several. My son has enjoyed building a few projects, too! Thank you, Elenco, for making these educational yet entertaining kits available, especially when kids and their parents are staying home most of the time during the COVID-19 pandemic. I'm sure we'll be ordering more of them. (One downside: One of the two battery kits in the larger kit won't work. I've seen rave reviews about Elenco's excellent customer service, so we'll be requesting a replacement so the 10-year-old can build what he's most excited about -- an FM radio.)",2
Snap Circuits Beginner Electronics Discovery Kit (Multi-Color),Electronics,25.99,5.0,United States,2020-04-18,I got this for my 6 year old boy for Christmas at the recommendation of a friend.  This is a great toy that promotes hands on learning about science.  My son loves playing with it and tries to rework the pieces to make his own circuits.  The company also has great customer service.  The spinning fan stopped working after a few months and that was his favorite piece.  I went to the company's website and they will send you replacement pieces for free (took about a week or so).  I am planning on getting the larger versions of this as he gets older.,0
Snap Circuits Beginner Electronics Discovery Kit (Multi-Color),Electronics,25.99,5.0,United States,2020-01-08,"I was somewhat skeptical about buying this for a five year old but I figured I would give it a shot.  It turned out to be a great gift for my five year old grandson, and his sister at three was able to do some basic stuff with supervision (her choice - I did not push this on her).  After two sessions with me, they were able to go through the instructions by themselves.  While we worked on the kit together, I was able to talk some basics to the five year old (!!!) concerning circuits and switches (and one-way LEDS). Almost unbelievable, but the gospel truth.I highly recommend this kit!",1
Snap Circuits Beginner Electronics Discovery Kit (Multi-Color),Electronics,25.99,5.0,United States,2019-12-26,"I bought this for my 5 year old son who is a budding engineer and loved all things robotics, electrical, and building. It is a great little kit and depsite the fact that he can't read yet, my 5 year old son worked through all 21 builds almost completely by himself in one day. He literally wouldn't put it down.He still goes back to it too!I bought a ""skills building kit"" to add to it and he loves it too! I think these are awesome and a great value for all the fun and learning included.I will be buying these for gifts for other kids in the future.",0
Snap Circuits Beginner Electronics Discovery Kit (Multi-Color),Electronics,25.99,3.0,United States,2019-12-26,"This is a fine STEM toy. It does have a flaw - the EGG. When you install the egg on the LED (which looked cool BTW), the egg acts like a huge lever on the two tiny wires that connects the diode. Whatever you do to the egg, say pushing it, pulling it, twisting it, etc., even with the lightest touch, will notably bend the wires. I tried to keep my 4 year old from touching the egg as much as I can but still, within one hour the LED is snapped off. This is clearly a design flaw - the base of the LED should have been sandwiched between two plastic pieces, rather than mounted on the top surface.",1
Snap Circuits Beginner Electronics Discovery Kit (Multi-Color),Electronics,25.99,5.0,United States,2020-03-02,"We bought this for my 6 year old for Christmas. He has loved playing with it and it's perfectly suited for his age. He can do all the projects outlined in the manual by himself. It's easy to use and holds his interest. We have had to replace two parts so far (two months in). One of the lamps (L4) and the battery pack (B3B) have broken already. The plastic piece holding the battery anodes broke in two places from the pressure of the batteries against the spring. So far, Elenco has had great customer service and has replaced both pieces free of charge. But they will only replace three pieces per customer for free, and give the rate of breakage, I'm a little concerned I'll exceed that limit. My son loves this toy, and it's really one of the best Stem toys for his age group I've seen, so I still recommend it, but it would be nice if the pieces were a little higher quality.",0
Snap Circuits Beginner Electronics Discovery Kit (Multi-Color),Electronics,25.99,5.0,United States,2020-01-08,"I was skeptical that my 5 year old Nephew could use this kit by himself.  Was I wrong.  The way that the teaching book diagrams each project allows the child to visually see how each piece is installed.  The ease of installation of each piece gave him the confidence to experiment in each project.  After working with my Nephew on a couple of projects, he was ready to tackle the rest of the projects himself.  The pride and sense of accomplishment he experienced was priceless.  I would highly recommend this to anyone.",0
Snap Circuits Beginner Electronics Discovery Kit (Multi-Color),Electronics,25.99,5.0,United States,2020-02-26,I bought these for my STEM-excited Kindergartner. He has had so much fun discovering how electricity works and experimenting. I'm excited to get him the bigger sets for his birthday. My only wish is that they came with a booklet that parents could read to explain the science to the little scientists.,0
Snap Circuits Beginner Electronics Discovery Kit (Multi-Color),Electronics,25.99,5.0,United States,2020-04-14,"We got this years ago and every time I get it out I’m so pleased with how much my kids enjoy playing with it.

Snap Circuits Beginner Electronics Discovery Kit (Multi-Color),Electronics,25.99,5.0,United States,2020-02-13,This electronics kit includes 101 projects.

Snap Circuits Beginner Electronics Discovery Kit (Multi-Color),Electronics,25.99,3.0,United States,2020-01-02,"It's easy to use and comes with good directions, however doesn't come with all the parts that it lists in the instructions.

Snap Circuits PLUS Electronics Exploration Kits | Full Color Project Manual | STEM Educational Toy for Kids 8+ (SC-310),Electronics,nan,4.0,United Kingdom,2020-03-10,Another thing that is better now than it was when I was a kid.  This is an outstanding idea that makes building the circuits a breeze so you can focus on the learning.One point lost because 1) too much emphasis on noise-producing circuits and 2) the whistle chip is not sensitive enough for work properly in some examples.,3
Snap Circuits PLUS Electronics Exploration Kits | Full Color Project Manual | STEM Educational Toy for Kids 8+ (SC-310),Electronics,nan,4.0,United Kingdom,2019-12-21,"I had something a bit like this when I was a kid - that was over 50 years ago! The kt I had was made by Philips and was much more fiddly to use as the components were connected into the circuits using tiny spring clips and you needed to use wire strippers. This is much easier to use as the components are mounted on plugs which locate into a board. Bought this for one of my nephews for Christmas. He hasn't actually received it yet, but I'm anticipating most of the family will enjoy building electronic gadgets with it.",3
Snap Circuits PLUS Electronics Exploration Kits | Full Color Project Manual | STEM Educational Toy for Kids 8+ (SC-310),Electronics,nan,3.0,United Kingdom,2019-12-30,My son loves this.  We’ve tried a few circuits and he loves seeing the results and understanding how things work.So why only 3 stars??  A couple of the components are faulty (one being a switch that works intermittently).  I haven’t contacted the seller yet but hopefully they’ll replace the faulty parts and I’ll adjust the rating accordingly.  This was purchased at a reduced price during Cyber Monday deals so I don’t particularly want a refund as I’d have to pay much more to replace it so I’m hoping the seller will resolve the issue directly.,11

Hot Wires Electronics Kit from John Adams,Electronics,35.99,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-01-04,"My grandson (aged 7) is not very academic, but thoroughly enjoys the little electronic projects they make at school. He was absolutely delighted with this kit, which contains the bits and pieces to make lots of little electronic gizmos. Stupid Grandma let the side down however by failing to provide any batteries! We robbed something else of its batteries so he could get one of the projects going.As an aside, I opted to have this delivered 'without Amazon packaging'. I understand that this means the contents will be visible, but to my horror, the box arrived with no packaging at all and the address label stuck straight on the box. It took me at least half an hour to carefully, carefully, peel this off and then another half hour gently rubbing the sticky residue off with nail varnish remover to make it look like a present again. The box also arrived quite battered, which I couldn't do anything about. Lesson learned there!",1

Clear slots to keep pieces in place after use. Includes bulbs, switches etc but you need AA batteries - 6 of them - 3 in each battery pack.",12

Hot Wires Electronics Kit from John Adams,Electronics,35.99,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-01-20,"My son won this as a competition prize.  He's recently turned 7 and I wasn't sure if he would manage given it says 8+, but it's a brilliant combination of being simple to put together, but having enough about it for it to be suitable for much older in terms of the learning involved.  He can follow the instructions himself, but the concepts will keep him learning more for several years.  His current favourite is the spinning disc (although he did lose it behind a bookcase yesterday).  We were at a relatives on Saturday and he literally spent all day on it, several hours on it on Sunday, did another two experiments before school today (and was excited to show me his dark activated light).  My 70+ year old Dad loved doing some of it with him - especially the sound activated light.  I thought I might be worried about him breaking it but it's really solid construction.",0

Stylophone The Original Pocket Electronic Organ,Electronics,24.99,4.0,United Kingdom,2020-04-02,"Probably cost around £2 to manufacture - It feels tacky, the plastic is cheap & nasty, the gold finish on the logo is already wearing away and it's absolutely brilliant!! I've definitely had my 20 quids worth.

Great for annoying co-workers with my renditions of 80s classics in the office (back when working in offices was still a thing) Now I do the same but using Microsoft Teams (other remote working solutions are available)

If you're of a certain age and can remember these from the first time around, get one - it'll put a smile on your face.
What else are you going to spend your money on now the pubs are closed?

Just don't mention the original ad campaign. ;-)",20
Stylophone The Original Pocket Electronic Organ,Electronics,24.99,1.0,United Kingdom,2020-01-02,"A present for my young nephew - if I could award minus 5 stars I would. This is an extremely poor imitation of the original - whilst pricey for what it is, it’s ultimately cheap and nasty. The manufacturers have cut every corner possible, using the cheapest, thinnest plastic, and the ‘keyboard’ is no longer made of sturdy metal but a stuck on foil sheet that scratches when the stylus is used. Complete rip off.",18

"Alesis CompactKit 4 – Tabletop Electric Drum Set with 70 Electronic / Acoustic Drum Kit Sounds, 4 Pads, Battery or AC-Power and Drum Sticks Included",Electronics,nan,3.0,United Kingdom,2020-07-17,"To be fair, you should be class this as a toy. I bought it for my 6 year old son, but being quite musical myself, I thought I'd get some enjoyment out of it, and I have. However, few things to note. One, sound quality of the different samples (the various drum noises) is varied by quality and volume. The speakers are poor and don't really do the unit justice. The ""coaching"" mode uses its built-in LCD screen, with one of four bars falling from the top to the bottom to indicate when to hit it (a bar each for each of the drum pads). These are designed to teach you some drum patterns. They range from fairly simple to really complicated. The idea is a good one. Where it falls down is that it has, by default, the drum backing track playing at the same time. You can turn this down in volume, but it is a distracting design decision. My ""bass"" drum pad is noticeably less responsive than the other 3. This leads to a bit of frustration as your hits aren't always registered. The pads seem nice rubber, but be aware, they will mark straight away - inherent in such a thing, but starts to look used immediately. There are built in tunes to play along with - more bontempi keyboard demo than Phil Collins. The pads are fairly small, and trying to keep up with the medium coaching mode had me hitting plastic rather than the drum pad. Taking of hitting, the sticks included are fine , plastic jobs, with just enough heft for this unit.This isn't a cheap unit, and I think I expected more quality than I got with it. My son played it once, and didn't use it again. Is it an intro to drumming? Any real interest in drumming will very very quickly leave this product wanting.

But it's not great. Other reviews mentioned a volume issue, and it's real. Sounds real easy to adjust the volume, and it is, except that it doesn't stay at that volume. Every time you switch songs or programs the volume goes back to the factory setting and you have to adjust it all over again. A simple rotary dial master is all it needs but nope, that's not what it has. If you are buying it as a gift for a kid it's fine. If you think this will make you a real drummer, or be good for practicing, think again. Many better options out there! If it was 1/4 the cost then maybe I'd be satisfied.

NOT for a homeowner looking for a how-to book on fixing things.  The author will recommend that you buy thousands of dollars of equipment for what?  Do you really think that you can fix the circuit board on  your TV!  The book is forty years too late.Now, if you are an electronics hobbyist, already invested in equipment and knowledge, this book represents a chance for  you to expand your knowledge more broadly.  It might teach you the value of additional equipment that you are considering purchasing.  And it might give you the extra insight to do something useful.

Chapter 2 is about buying the tools you'll need - a critical chapter!  Yet on ESR meters, it was insufficient info - do I need to be able to test voltage leakage?  Should the meter show capacitance value?  I've spent hours online looking for information that should have been in Chapter 2.Same chapter - oscilloscopes - no mention that if buying digital, you'll need at least 12bit memory for audio work.  No explanation of why you need 100mhz (I found a deal on a 40mhz - will it be ok?) - The book is intended for beginners, yet does not give the information a beginner would need.",36

Something I was already doing on a very basic level already. (Cleaning corrosion out of battery compartments, replacing a power cord etc) While I think a beginner would need something more basic to get started this was an great book for people who have already dared to try to fix various kinds of broken equipment and have figured out the basics-sort of. He gives a lot of detail on using meters and some very technical basics. Then he gives plenty of great practical advice about what to look for where and when that has already saved me some time. There are also stories that demonstrate the thought process an experienced repair person goes through while hunting down a problem that help you get the mindset right. Not for the faint of heart but if you find yourself servicing parts inside stuff labeled ‘no user serviceable parts’ anyway you need this book to guide you through forbidden territory and you will come out victorious a lot more often.",0

"Teach Yourself Electricity and Electronics, Sixth Edition",Electronics,nan,5.0,Canada,2020-01-21,"Teach Yourself Electricity and Electronics is an extensive crash course on electronics that is useful both to beginners and to more experienced people seeking to expand their knowledge. Structured like a series of correspondence courses in print form, the book guides you through each stage of electronics theory and application, quizzes you at the end of each chapter, then offers a final exam at the end. I found the best way to learn is to take notes while reading -- again, like you would in a college course -- and use those notes to remember key points and help you through the ""open book"" quizzes. Stan Gibilisco is clearly an expert in electronics, whose writing is clear and informative without ever dumbing-down the subject matter (another reason why even experienced electronics buffs will learn things and fill in gaps in their knowledge). I can't recommend this book highly enough.",0

"Practical Electronics for Inventors, Fourth Edition",Electronics,nan,5.0,United States,2020-04-02,"This is a huge reference work, but surprisingly accessible. The scope is massive. If you are trying to follow all the math, the theory section jumps into the formulas pretty quickly, and some background in physics or engineering might help. But that's what theory is all about, a mathematical foundation of the science. I really like the book. The only criticism I can think of so far, is that the volume is large (1027 pages) and heavy (4.5 pounds). Which, I suppose, makes it a bargain for the price.

For those interested and more mathematically inclined there are calculus proofs for physical quantities calculation. There are solved examples that fixate the theory. I don`t think it is a book for inventors, but if you want to start in this field and become more than just a simple beginner, this is the right book.

Chess Genius Pro Electronic Chess Set,Electronics,nan,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-02-13,"I was looking for an electronic chess board that didn't cost an arm and a leg but was still pretty good.  I'm pleased with this, I think it looks great, the computer plays very well. But there are some things that need improving imo. Not enough space to store the pieces. The power socket should be at the back, else you end up with the lead coming out the front. The pieces are a a little cheap looking although I do like the silver. As far as software features, there's a few choices for length of games etc and various other set up options, but there's no feature that gives you a rating as you finish each game.  It would be great if it matched your rating with an appropriate opponent rating. I still enjoy it and I'd certainly recommend it to anyone who wants electronic chess but isn't expecting things like internet play etc.",1

Bedside Wireless Charging Non Ticking Radio Alarm Clock with Dimmable LED Display - Mains Powered Dual Alarm Clock with USB Charger and Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,32.99,1.0,United Kingdom,2020-07-01,"I read many reviews on this before purchasing but non mentioned the radio alarm volume. Several reviews said that the product is difficult to use which I agree with a little. It is quite complicated to use but ok. The issue I have with it is the radio alarm volume. It is so loud! You cannot change the volume which you are woken with. I set the volume low but this makes no difference. It begins quiet but within seconds it is unbearable. It doesn’t give you chance to press sleep/snooze before you are deafened.  Not a nice way to wake! I did email the manufacturer to see if I was setting it wrong or if there is a fault. Their reply - “In its current form the Alarm/Radio volume is ramped and designed to increase in volume its sole aim to get the individual out of Bed.Having a controllable Alarm volume is a high priority and something we are currently looking at but it would require a Hardware change, so the feature is not something that can be introduced in the short term”Other reviews said the wireless charging is a little temperamental in that you have to put the device in specific place. I’ve used it for 2 weeks & yes I have had to reposition phone until it’s recognised but not had a problem. Until tonight when it won’t charge at all. I give up! It’s going back.",34
Bedside Wireless Charging Non Ticking Radio Alarm Clock with Dimmable LED Display - Mains Powered Dual Alarm Clock with USB Charger and Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,32.99,3.0,United Kingdom,2020-03-07,"Overall I like this clock, with great sound quality and handy phone charging. But it has a few irritating features which may be deal breakers for some and could so easily have been put right during design. Firstly it’s 5 stage dimming is unnecessary as even the dimmest is way too bright and illuminates my room! And if you turn the display off but want to check the time in the night by pressing the button, it lights up (with a loud click) at its brightest setting! You then have to do a further 4 loud clicks to take it back to the ‘off’ setting. By which time everyone in your room is wide awake!",12
Bedside Wireless Charging Non Ticking Radio Alarm Clock with Dimmable LED Display - Mains Powered Dual Alarm Clock with USB Charger and Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,32.99,3.0,United Kingdom,2020-02-18,"Nice looking very neat and easy to set up, however it wasn't until the first morning when the alarm went off (it was set to radio not bleep) that I noticed to volume gets louder and louder. Re-read the instructions nothing to tell you how to stop this. I contacted the manufactures who replied stating that there was no way of setting the alarm volume the 'getting louder' was part of the design feature. Also there is not the option to set alarms for certain days i.e. mon-fri or mon-wed-fri etc so if you work a varied shift pattern you have to remember to manually switch the alarm completely off or else you are woken up when you don't want to be. In hind sight had I been aware of the lack of these features I would not have purchased this. It does charge my iPhone ok but that's not really the point !!!",31
Bedside Wireless Charging Non Ticking Radio Alarm Clock with Dimmable LED Display - Mains Powered Dual Alarm Clock with USB Charger and Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,32.99,4.0,United Kingdom,2020-07-19,"I keep my mobile phones a long time, and the first thing which wears has been the USB hole. The solution is to not use it and charge the phone on a pad. I've had two pads in the past year and their quality has been appalling. I wanted a clock radio anyway so, when my latest charging pad died, I decided to combine the two and this seemd to fit the bill.
This definately does fit the bill. Charging a phone on top is as simple as falling off a log. The FM radio is simple to operate and the instruction manual takes you through setting up the clock with the minimum of fuss. I did wonder why the unit didn't set up it's clock off the fm radio signals, but never mind.
I also wondered why the radio didn't do DAB, then I realised that I could use the bluetooth connection to my phone anyway. DAB would be a pointless expense.
The brightness settings on the clock are good. Would be nice to have day and date s well.
Excellent unit, stylish and easy to use.",10
Bedside Wireless Charging Non Ticking Radio Alarm Clock with Dimmable LED Display - Mains Powered Dual Alarm Clock with USB Charger and Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,32.99,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-02-27,"The product is a brilliant alarm clock radio, other reviews say that the light for the digital display was too bright even on the lowest setting but i didnt find this a problem at all, on the dimmest setting i could hardly read the numbers so i didnt see the issue.

The sound quality is very good at low to medium volume but not something you could blast your music out through.

It does the job, is very stylish and is not too bulky or large for a dresser which also had a lamp and other items on it. I'm very happy with this purchace and really like the fact theres a USB charging port on the back!

Now I'm not sure if it was the clock or phone making the beeping but when I took my phone off the clock it and the clock was red hot and i mean extremely hot. My phone (s10) was behaving really strange but after restarting it it was ok. I've since charged my phone on another wireless charger and all ok. Since this episode I've been afraid to use it overnight and have returned to amazon. Please please be careful. I dread to think what would have been the outcome if we hadn't woke!,4
Bedside Wireless Charging Non Ticking Radio Alarm Clock with Dimmable LED Display - Mains Powered Dual Alarm Clock with USB Charger and Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,32.99,3.0,United Kingdom,2020-06-12,What a performance to set the time on this contraption!  Drove me nuts. Only ordered it for the readout of time which can be adjusted and the fact that it is supposed to charge your phone. Well that’s okay if you take your phone out of it’s hard shell case but as that’s not a quick and easy task you don’t bother. Frankly don’t know why I’m bothering with this. It is neat and quite smart though to have on your bedside table. Guess it will be useful for overnight guests- when we’re allowed them!!!,2
Bedside Wireless Charging Non Ticking Radio Alarm Clock with Dimmable LED Display - Mains Powered Dual Alarm Clock with USB Charger and Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,32.99,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-06-26,Great clock I love the Bluetooth it works really well with a good speaker and you can listen to your phone's play list while your phone is charging on top my biggest issue is with other Qi wireless chargers once the phone is charged at 100% it doesn't have an automatic stop charge I left my phone to charge and when I woke up it was very hot wich was worrying as to any damage that heat over hours mite create so you shouldn't leav it charging over nite apart from that it's really good as a charger,2
Bedside Wireless Charging Non Ticking Radio Alarm Clock with Dimmable LED Display - Mains Powered Dual Alarm Clock with USB Charger and Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,32.99,4.0,United Kingdom,2020-06-02,"Purchased this clock radio after looking for a very long time trying to find the right look and was very pleased with the design and ease of use. The sound quality is great and even at its lowest setting, still very clear and loud enough to wake you, but this is also why I’m now returning the product. After setting the alarm, the radio is triggered but then increases in volume, which is very very loud. I contacted the manufacturer who responded very quickly and explained this is a feature which cannot be altered until they develop the software. Absolutely gutted that I now have to return the item, and iBox’s other products have the same feature.",3
Bedside Wireless Charging Non Ticking Radio Alarm Clock with Dimmable LED Display - Mains Powered Dual Alarm Clock with USB Charger and Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,32.99,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-03-08,This really is a great product.  Build is robust and looks great. Sound quality is more than adequate with good volume. Display goes from bright to very dim to completely off. Wireless charging works great plus a usb at the back for another device.  Bluetooth signal is strong with no dropouts from my S10. FM radio has plenty of presets and works fine.  A DAB version would be nice but I would expect to pay more for that. And is it needed when you can stream from your phone anyway?,3
Bedside Wireless Charging Non Ticking Radio Alarm Clock with Dimmable LED Display - Mains Powered Dual Alarm Clock with USB Charger and Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,32.99,1.0,United Kingdom,2019-12-30,"Bought this for my husband as he has numerous wires for his electronic bits. It’s an alarm clock radio with a charger built in; however it doesn’t keep time. My own alarm went off at 6:40 this morning, and it happily displayed 3:56. This was after re-setting it at midnight. It’s going back. The radio is fine (it’s as good as it’s replacement), and it charges ok, hence the one star overall.",3
Bedside Wireless Charging Non Ticking Radio Alarm Clock with Dimmable LED Display - Mains Powered Dual Alarm Clock with USB Charger and Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,32.99,2.0,United Kingdom,2020-06-10,I am having to amend my previous review. When I first purchased this alarm clock it was for my husband it seemed to take all the boxes however less than a year and this is my second clock we found that the charging point is very temperamental sometimes it will charge sometimes it won’t it works better if you remove your iPhone case but that’s a bit of a Pfaff. after a few months it randomly started going off (alarm) and the last straw was when the display went completely bonkers and you couldn’t read it. so I have had to send it back and I will not replace it again.,1
Bedside Wireless Charging Non Ticking Radio Alarm Clock with Dimmable LED Display - Mains Powered Dual Alarm Clock with USB Charger and Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,32.99,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-02-15,"I’m really pleased with this item, it looks great blending into my decor without being ‘in your face’ and best of all I love the fact that you can dim the clock light so it does shine too brightly and fill your room with light at night, that does mean you don’t see the clock in the day time unless you adjust it. But it’s in my bedroom so I don’t need to see it in the day time.I haven’t been able to use the phone charge facility with my iPhone 6 as it just doesn’t do anything, but that’s not a big problem.It’s easy to use and best of all it’s made in the UK which is a big plus!",1

Bedside Wireless Charging Non Ticking Radio Alarm Clock with Dimmable LED Display - Mains Powered Dual Alarm Clock with USB Charger and Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,32.99,4.0,United Kingdom,2020-07-30,"The clock arrived and it is a quality item. Set up was a little difficult and the first night, I thought I'd set everything up, but I had failed to set the alarm. With so few buttons, it makes setting stuff up a little difficult. The charger works through my phone case and the radio is ok. The thing I love most it the light dimming feature. Lots of settings, including switching the LED display off. Overall a good radio/bluetooth alarm, but read instructions carefully when setting up for the first time.",1
Bedside Wireless Charging Non Ticking Radio Alarm Clock with Dimmable LED Display - Mains Powered Dual Alarm Clock with USB Charger and Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,32.99,2.0,United Kingdom,2020-03-14,"Sound quality is poor and there is a ""hiss"" coming through the speakers even with the antenna wire extended around the room. The brightness is OK but needs to be changed from night time (so it doesn't keep you awake) to day time (so you can red the actual time!).

I use the Bluetooth a lot. Just leave it in Bluetooth mode. It seems to be a reliable connection and has always connected ok.
The wireless charging works well.
I’d like the display to go even dimmer but it’s not bad. I have a very dark room.
I`v also noticed that if you turn it down with the buttons on the clock you can't turn it back up via bluetooth. Sound quality is ok.",0

Bedside Wireless Charging Non Ticking Radio Alarm Clock with Dimmable LED Display - Mains Powered Dual Alarm Clock with USB Charger and Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,32.99,4.0,United Kingdom,2020-06-05,This is fab and gets rid of a clunky old radio and all the wires for my phone and a little usb fan I use in the summer. I’d give it 5 stars but as others have pointed out the increasing volume on the alarm would be nice to set at a fixed rate. It definitely wakes you up though! If you ever develop a DAB version you could easily charge double for it 👍,0
Bedside Wireless Charging Non Ticking Radio Alarm Clock with Dimmable LED Display - Mains Powered Dual Alarm Clock with USB Charger and Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,32.99,4.0,United Kingdom,2020-06-07,"I like this product, the sound quality is very good and, although it's bigger than i thought it would be, it's fairly attractive. The wireless charging is also very cool. I have no issues with the brightness of the clock, although mine came with some stick on LED blockers which (I assume) were put in for some DIY light blocking. Bear in mind that this radio always needs to be plugged in, moving it even around the room will cause it to forget all of the settings you had tuned it to. My only other issue with it is how loud the radio is when it goes off as an alarm in the morning - I bought it thinking the radio could wake me up and then stay on but i have to turn it off immediately because it's so loud! Not a huge issue though.",0

Display brightness options are good, can even turn display off completely if you want your room really dark but I found the lowest brightness setting fine. Wireless charging is convenient. Definitely worth reading the instructions as controls aren't immediately obvious from the button labels. Unfortunately the radio, even on the lowest volume setting is still too loud in the morning (I think we woke up our next door neighbours when we were testing it!). We got round this by connecting it to our Amazon Echo Flex via Bluetooth and using that for the alarm instead.",1

I’ve had an iPhone XS Max and just XS with this charger now and on numerous occasions I’ve woken up the next day and the phone hasn’t fully charged.The manual says how phones may need to be aligned in certain ways but I can’t see why it should be such a small charging window.

"WD 4 TB Elements Portable External Hard Drive - USB 3.0, Black",Electronics,69.74,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-04-03,"Delivered about an hour or two ago, gave it some time to acclimatise to indoor temp after its journey on the cold van, which you should ALWAYS do with products like this.  Plugged in to a USB3.0 port on a Win10 machine, opens straight up to a nice empty folder, good to use straight away.There's some misinformation posted in a lot of reviews here, or maybe more accurately, misunderstandings, so I'll clear these up here.1.  The drive size *IS* 4GB.  4,000,750,497,792 bytes to be exact.Anyone complaining that it's only 3.6TB I'm afraid doesn't understand how hard drive formatting works.  Which is fair enough, you wouldn't know about this if you've little or no experience of these things.  Once a drive of any kind - hard drive, SSD, flash drive USB stick - is formatted for use, you lose a proportion of all those little bytes to how file systems need to mark and index all the sections of the drive so that every bit of data can be found.  Like a little address index of where everything lives on it, if you like.  And that takes up some space.So, once 4TB is formatted for use, there's 3.63TB of actual file storage space left empty.2.  This drive is preformatted to NTFS.  Which is my own preference for this, but you can format it yourself to anything else you use, like FAT32, exFAT32, or HFS+ and APFS for Apples.3.  I'm seeing both read and write speed, over USB 3.0, is 115-125MB per second.4. The actual hard drive in this package is a WDC WD40NMZW-59GX6S1SAFETY TIP:  Don't lift, tilt or turn the drive (or ANY hard drive) while it's working.  You might get away with it, but if you butterfingers it and drop it while it's running there's a good chance it's doneski.  It's a tiny little box and meant to be easily used with laptops, tablets, etc, so it's really asking to be handled in use but TRY your best not to move it around when it's working.  When it's not working, the heads park themselves safely away off from the disc surfaces inside, so dropping it then from a small height has a fair chance of being OK, but NEVER when it's running.",8

On first use the drive made clicking noises when copying files to it. The copy failed and after trying to re-format the drive, disk utility said the drive was faulty and would not dismount.  Replacement drive was delivered the next day. Again same problems. I must either have terrible luck receiving drives from a bad batch, or that the WD 5TB is simply badly made. In any case I am now turning to a different brand.",5
"WD 4 TB Elements Portable External Hard Drive - USB 3.0, Black",Electronics,69.74,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-05-05,"I wanted the biggest capacity I could find that is compatible with a PS4 whilst not breaking the bank. This 4TB HD seemed to fit the bill. The 500GB drive on the standard PS4 isn't enough for more than a few games and i only have 1 digital version (GTA V) and the rest are on physical disk. I reckon even the 1TB Pro version needs an upgrade like this.

Installation - it was so easy I can't remember the exact steps and didn't need to follow any instructions. You pug it into one of the powered USB ports on the front with the lead that comes with it and it's on. The PS4 did prompt me to tell me which menu to find it in. You do need to format it the first time which just means it makes it ready for PS4 instead of a PC. This took about 5 seconds to complete. The bit that took the time was moving my existing games / saved games over to the external drive. Might have taken an hour or 2 but you only need to do this once. Also the time will depend on how many games you need to move over.

Since then I've forgotten about it. You can't hear it at all. It's black and fits in with the PS4 (see picture). Now I feel more comfortable downloading games rather than buying physical disks. Really useful if you have a PS Plus subscription as you'll get new games every month for free!

There are several brands out there and I read a lot of reviews. I just went with this as others said it was PS4 friendly and I can vouch for that.",2
"WD 4 TB Elements Portable External Hard Drive - USB 3.0, Black",Electronics,69.74,4.0,United Kingdom,2020-05-07,"First of all, I love how you can buy so much storage space for such a relatively low price nowadays. And how it can squeeze into such a small drive. This in itself is perfect.
The speeds also seem decent enough - as good as you can expect from an HDD like this one. Make sure you're using usb3 if you want to maximise it.

What's causing me to drop a star is shortly after copying some files to the drive I noticed one of the files was corrupted. Now I'm not sure if this is the doing of the drive or something else but either way I was not pleased. I would love if drives provided some kind of reassurance that your files were not corrupted (or some kind of utility to check your data health) - especially drives like this one where you're scared of moving it around too much since there's moving parts.

I'm going to keep using the drive and update the review as to whether there were any other incidents of corruption. So far I haven't noticed anything else expect that one file.",1

Hell No. If I returned them it would cost me, but refusing delivery wouldn't.

I already have 3. A Toshiba 1tb and 2 WM passports 1tb each, one usb 2 & other usb 3.
Independent Backup storage is a must. I dont trust cloud storage. If sony can get hacked! Etc.
Also Bitter experience when I had no backup... my dodgie daughter killed my computor with an even dodgier website!!
All hard drives are good although WM usb2 one didn't shut down properly once or twice to allow safe disconnection. All much faster storage than all my usb stick drives.
I like 1tb. It's massive enough for photos videos but also Sony PS4 storage. Having 4x1tb units has the advantage if a unit fails I don't loose everything.
I learnt from again from bitter experience its better to leaving 1tb with photos elsewhere. Rotating regular guards against loosing precious memories to fire and other home destroyers! Fire boxes won't stop them melting!!! Not my daughters doing that time!
Another point. I have micro and standard usb storage. You won't accidently put it through a wash and dryer. Although the toshiba stick did still work. And the WM won't slip out your pocket unnoticed or your dog find it and chew it!!!
Have fun! D",1
"WD 4 TB Elements Portable External Hard Drive - USB 3.0, Black",Electronics,69.74,1.0,United Kingdom,2020-01-03,"Whilst this drive does *technically* work with a PS4, don't allow yourself to get a false sense of security. The drive does not require an external power source beyond the USB itself, which (from what I can gather) seems to be the root of the problem. It seems that the PS4 USB ports don't always supply the perfect level of power for the drive, so it's smooth operation is very hit and miss. It something happens to the power supply (power outage, shutting the PS4 down completely, sometimes even just putting it into rest mode - yes, with the setting on to keep power running to the USB ports), the drive start to spin, beep once, and then emit a sustained and unbearable beep until you unplug the power. The only way at this point to get it working again is through pure trial and error. Unplug / plug during a full reboot, unplug / plug while going in / out of rest mode. Extremely irritating - especially when you've spent 15 minutes trying to find the right combination to get the drive powered properly, of which you also spent the last 10 of those minutes convinced it will never work again and that you've lost all of your data. Sadly, I'd stupidly disposed of the packaging before I realised that this was going to an ongoing problem, so I wasn't able to return it. WD won't do anything, as technically the drive works (they've since changed their item description to remove any reference to PS4).

"Horstmann Electronic 7 Water Heater, Multi",Electronics,69.64,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-02-23,"My daughter just bought a flat and seller had replaced the old cylinder boiler with a new one.
The Horstmann timer was very old and working fine, but i wanted to change this for a digital one.
After reading the reviews and contacting Horstmann technical service, a really nice guy, Steve, assured me
how easy this was to change.
As mentioned by other users here, this is a doddle to change.
Switch off power. Unscrew the old front face. There are 5 wires connected to the back plate, via spade connectors.
They are marked 1 to 5. Simply pull each one out, remove the old front face.
This new one is a direct backwards compatible, with the same 5 wires, spade connections.
Simply push each one to the corresponding number on the back plate. Offer this plate to back box,
and screw to back box.
Set the GMT/BST switch. All done. Its factory pre programmed for economy 7, so you dont have to set the time.
Fantastic product.",2
"Horstmann Electronic 7 Water Heater, Multi",Electronics,69.64,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-03-06,"What they say is what you get. Great product from Horstmann. Bought as a replacement for their  older manual timer, fitted to the original back box without rewiring. Just unscrew the old timer from the back box, remove the cable push fittings and replace with the new one. It so easy as the cable connections are numbered on both the cable connectors and the back box.",0
"Horstmann Electronic 7 Water Heater, Multi",Electronics,69.64,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-04-01,Only had it 2 days but substantially better then my old unit. Water v hot now. I would recommend this product for an economy 7 user. Its versatile so would suit most peoples needs with an emersion boiler.,0
"Horstmann Electronic 7 Water Heater, Multi",Electronics,69.64,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-01-07,So simple to install as I had the old version. Means I am finally able to control my water tank. Not paying a fortune when I don't need to. Very happy.,0
"Horstmann Electronic 7 Water Heater, Multi",Electronics,69.64,1.0,United Kingdom,2019-12-28,"Not the easiest to install, timers are difficult to set especially with the second timer option. The boost option timer affects  the boost button from working.",0
"Horstmann Electronic 7 Water Heater, Multi",Electronics,69.64,2.0,United Kingdom,2020-01-23,The clock change feature is always three months late on mine (so it changes the time in mid-summer and mid-winter instead of at the end of march and the end of october). Otherwise it's OK and a slight improvement on the old analogue one I had before.,0

Bose SoundSport Wireless Headphones - Blue,Electronics,95.00,4.0,United Kingdom,2020-06-01,"Let's start of with the good points.
- Sound quality is fantastic. Even when turned up really high there is no breaking up of the sound.
-Battery life Is good around 6 hours
- They're pretty rugged. They've been dropped, thrown around in and out of bags and they're still just fine.
- Really easy to pair up with any bluetooth device.

And now for the not so good things.

- They're not the comfiest of earphones to wear and dont sit in the ear very well
- The cable comes of the clip that you clip to your collar all the time
- If you try to run with them in you will spend more time stopping to rearrange / put them back in your ears then you will actually running.

All in all they are great earphones. The sound quality is quite remarkable. Like others have said, just don't use them for sports.",1
Bose SoundSport Wireless Headphones - Blue,Electronics,95.00,1.0,United Kingdom,2020-04-10,"Headphones had great sound quality... However the headphones broke just 18 days after purchase. They started beeping and then died. I tried charging them at different ports, different plugs, etc but they were still dead.

I would not expect this from most speaker/headphone manufacturers but especially not Bose. These earphones cost me £114 and for that kind of price I would expect these to last years. I have gone back to my wired headphones which have lasted me well over 6 years now!

Amazon were great and provided me with a full refund and extended return policy so no fault on their side.",1
Bose SoundSport Wireless Headphones - Blue,Electronics,95.00,2.0,United Kingdom,2020-02-04,"When I lost my old running headphones, I looked at all the reviews for possible replacements - and I found there wasn't an obvious winner. Clearly there's a lot of subjectivity in headphones, particularly when it comes to comfort. I chose the Bose in large part because all the truly wireless ones I considered had a feature I disliked about my old Plantronics Backbeat Fit headphones: to adjust volume, or to hit pause, effectively requires jamming the tiny speakers into your ear. Which can't be good for your ears; and hurts. With the Bose, the control is on the band, not the speaker. The sound quality is excellent. But I found the fit uncomfortable: the design requires putting them in the ear and twisting them, which creates a seal like some sort of sonic toilet plunger. It's as fun as that sounds. When I ran, they fell out 3 times over the course of an hour. I tried a different size of ear hook (3 sizes come in the box) but still they felt uncomfortable. (Additional, niche issue: if you wear these at the gym, and do squats with a barbell, you may find that the little metal shirt clip is exactly where you'd rest the bar on your shoulders.)A big thank you to Amazon Prime, though: I contacted support to explain I'd worn the headphones and they weren't comfortable; could I send them back? Yes, they said. I can't imagine many retailers would offer a full refund on headphones after they've been put in someone's ears. Here's hoping for you, dear reader, they're not re-sold to you.",1
Bose SoundSport Wireless Headphones - Blue,Electronics,95.00,2.0,United Kingdom,2019-12-09,"I've had these for a year now, and have used them frequently, mostly in the gym and running etc.  This is my first review, but I thought it worth doing as these cost quite a bit of money.The whole time I've used these the poor fitment has been a constant niggle.  I wouldn't say I have odd ears in any way, normal ear buds always fit great, but the design of these do not fit at all well.  They sound great as long as you're not doing much and you're in a quiet environment, but as soon as you use these for any sport related activity (so there's either wind noise, music in the background, or you're own movement) they lose the seal in your ear and you get lots of background noise, even at full volume.  This is especially crap considering they're sold as being made for sport.I have tried the other size rubber attachments that are included, as well as paying extra for aftermarket ones.  None have fit properly and I'm now sure it's just down to the poor design of these rubber bits.  So after finally giving in after a lot of frustration I have bought new wireless earbuds at half the price, which seem to sound just as good but also seal perfectly.",2
Bose SoundSport Wireless Headphones - Blue,Electronics,95.00,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-05-11,"I wanted some headphones for when Im at the gym, running and doing stuff in the garden as one of my AirPods nearly fell out and landed in a can of fence paint! Also, suitable for when its raining. I've only used these a few times but they sound amazing, feel comfortable and look cool. Just what I expect from Bose. I bought the charging case too  which is a nice little addition. Excellent. I love them. I also bought my girlfriend the Bose Pulse version and she loves them.",0
Bose SoundSport Wireless Headphones - Blue,Electronics,95.00,2.0,United Kingdom,2020-07-01,"These were great to begin with.

Gutted as these are not cheap. Do mot recommend.",0

Good battery backup, I have used for 6-8 hours on and off and battery comes down to 10% and requests for a charge ( it basically mumbles that in your ear). The cables and sound quality is still as good as it was when new.

Bose SoundSport Wireless Headphones - Blue,Electronics,95.00,4.0,United Kingdom,2020-04-12,"First the good stuff. I am very fussy and awkward about comfort, I have big lug holes so buds are completely useless. The ear comfort of the Bose is very good - it does not feel like the ear canal is plugged and the silicon wings hold them in place just right. The sound is, as you would expect from Bose, awesome and full of punch. The disappointing part is the controls - they are so stiff and clunky that, apart from the pause button, none can be carried out by feel. The on/off switch is just simply hard as are the volume controls on the lead close to the right earpiece - just simple up and down buttons. Just a simple smooth rocker switch would have been fine. It’s not a deal breaker as you can use the phone controls obvs and indeed the wear / sound quality easily trumps this annoyance. It’s just bizarre that Bose have not paid sufficient attention to this design aspect.",0
Bose SoundSport Wireless Headphones - Blue,Electronics,95.00,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-01-02,I picked a pair of these up almost 4 years ago and they were one of the best pieces of personal tech I have ever invested in. The fit is absolutely perfect and clearly thought out. This is far removed from the efforts of beats for instance with their poor hook design. As far as the sound goes.. well its Bose.. if you don't know their quality you haven't owned any of their products before. My pair did actually start to break down after 4 years of use in both the gym and all other aspects of my life. I contacted Bose to ask about repairs as I'm of the mind these days that repair is better than disposal. To my surprise they simply replaced them! I'm assuming they re-use electronic components and it's the plastics that are disposed of perhaps. I can not recommend their products and their customer service more.,0
Bose SoundSport Wireless Headphones - Blue,Electronics,95.00,2.0,United Kingdom,2020-07-03,"So let’s start with the good: the sound quality is really good with rich, deep base notes. They’re a snug fit and are fairly discrete and connectivity is good (no lip syncing issues when watching video). That’s where it ends I’m afraid. The problems started when I took the on holiday and BOSE issued a software update - despite having downloaded the BOSE App for these, the software update left them utterly useless because you to be connected to a laptop/Mac to install the updates! So I’m sitting on a beach with an iPad Pro and and perfectly useless pair of BOSE because they won’t connect to anything until you run the update! I could forgive that (I think!), but within 6 months the casing on the phones literally began falling apart - no joke, literally came away from the phones, and the same happened to the casing on the control unit. Shame....really good sound but couldn’t recommend them to anyone.",0
Bose SoundSport Wireless Headphones - Blue,Electronics,95.00,1.0,United Kingdom,2020-01-02,"Sound quality is good, they fit well and the connectivity is good, and so you are probably wondering why I’ve given them 1 star.

Bose SoundSport Wireless Headphones - Blue,Electronics,95.00,1.0,Canada,2020-04-27,"Sounds quality is great, of course its Bose. No noise cancellation probably because they do not fit my ears even with different sizing. If you have small ears I dont recommend these at all, ear fatigue with 10 minutes of wearing them. Even on the smallest size. I'm not sure why they thought an oval entrance piece would be a smart idea but they dont sit in my ears nicely. Just all around uncomfortable, they are also a lot larger than I anticipated, especially for Bose and there quality. They charged quickly otherwise and came with a case. These would be great if you had average or larger ears for sure. The overall quality is good, I'm just really disappointed with the fit of these

Update: august 2020, not far into owning these now. Already starting to break,cord is separating from earphone, these are not ""roughly"" used either. Super disappointed I wasted so much money on these. Do yourself a favor and buy the monster ones. I had mine for 10 years and they only broke because my kitten ate the cord otherwise they'd probably still be working and ok only paid 70$ for them (the bass was better to) come on Bose. Step it up , these are huge, inconvenient, and not savvy to the little ears , the build quality is CHEAP .

Another update: left headphone has crapped out, and the mic. DO NOT BUY THESE PIECES OF GARBAGE.",5
Bose SoundSport Wireless Headphones - Blue,Electronics,95.00,5.0,Canada,2020-01-08,Really love these they stay in my ears well which has been a problem with just about every other set of earbuds I've had. These do not hurt at all and stay in even while I'm at the gym. The clip on the wire connecting them is great for that extra assurance that you wont lose them if they do pop out though I havent had them come out yet.Sound quality is good and seem kinda quiet at first but I could still hear my music with the loud ass yell talkers on the bus. Sound cancellation isnt great but it's good enough. I kind of like that I can still hear the faint sound of cars and things. I want hear when people talk to me unless I'm on less than 50% volume.I've been using them for a week and have charged them once. Around 1-2hours a day.Highly recommend the hard charge case mainly to protect then when not in use. The case it comes with is just fabric.,1

Bose SoundSport Wireless Headphones - Blue,Electronics,95.00,3.0,Canada,2020-07-13,"The sound quality is amazing, as you'd expect from Bose, but for me the medium size ear pieces are a little too big and the small ones are too small. Because there's so much weight on these outside the ear, the small ones can't sit securely in my ears and just fall out as soon as I let go. (On my old wired Bose earbuds the small ones stay in fine, where the medium ones actually hurt my ears.) No chance of the small ones staying in with how heavy these are. The medium ones put a lot of pressure on my ears and they are not very comfortable as I am very sensitive to pressure around my head (I struggle with over the hear headphones). The photos are misleading with how far they stick out of your ears. It's actually ridiculous. I don't understand how they couldn't have come up with a more subtle looking design since so many other earbuds take up so much less space. I do like the fact the two sides are connected, I don't have to rely on two separate batteries being charged all the time and I've heard of annoying connection issues with the ""truely wireless"" style earbuds. So I don't have a problem with this in that part of the design. It's just how much weight is on he ears. I can't wear them to sleep if I need music to drown out other noise. I love the sound quality though so I'm really torn because I feel like I've now wasted a ton of money on headphones I don't love and I'm not sure I can be happy with. I had high hopes and I'm really disappointed.",0
Bose SoundSport Wireless Headphones - Blue,Electronics,95.00,1.0,India,2020-07-07,"I was planning to go for Jaybirds but I read many reviews where people got fake product and lots of issue about service in India.

I am using this more than 4 months and no issue at all.

Also the battery quality is very good and goes quite a long time.
You wont regret of spending this money.

Just an update to my review (After using around a year)

After using it for 1 year it has stopped working and the battery is not charging I had went to Bose service station and they told me none of the headsets which Bose is selling are repairable if they are in warranty they can only be replaced.

So it was a big shock to me and also looking at the total behaviour and hard work I did to reach Bose , make me think , it’s really not worth of buying this headsets.

Also the quality of rubber is too bad , buttons have came out and even the small flap which is near battery got damaged.I will post the photos soon for all the headphone

Big no to Bose Products, even if they sound great , if their is issue or damage , customer have to throw them in dustbin nothing else",1

Will it long last is unknown.",0
Bose SoundSport Wireless Headphones - Blue,Electronics,95.00,4.0,India,2019-12-09,Its quality is very good for music. Noise cancellation not up to mark.

If you have bit of losing - reconsider.. From my experience :)-,0

I needn't have worried.  My funny singing dogs gift voucher arrived on time.  How much on time, I'm not sure because the recipient couldn't find it and nearly ended up deleting it as it had gone into his spam folder.  He thought it was a scam and almost deleted it when he discovered it two days after I'd sent it!  It wasn't until I asked if he'd received it that he told me 'no' and I urged him to check his spam & trash folders, where it was discovered quietly lurking!I received an email as soon as I purchased it saying it had been sent and then another two days later saying it had been received.  Perhaps it only registers as being received once it has been put into the Gift Card section of the recipient's Amazon account.  Anyway, do send it a day or two before the occasion if you want the person to receive it on time because there does seem to be a bit of a longer delay than the fours hours stated in the terms and conditions.I'm definitely going to do this again though as I have another birthday coming up soon and the Covid thing isn't going to go away overnight.  I opted for an all-singing, all-dancing version - there are loads to choose from and they are are hilarious and don't cost any more than the boring ones with the plain Amazon logo.

"TP-Link AV600 Powerline Adapter Wi-Fi Kit, Wi-Fi Booster/Hotspot/ Extender, Wi-Fi Speed up to 300Mbps, 2+1 Ethernet Ports, No Configuration Required, Wi-Fi Auto-Sync, UK Plug (TL-WPA4220 KIT)",Electronics,38.99,3.0,United Kingdom,2020-03-03,"This does two things: it extends your internet connection over your house mains wiring (which it does very well and is dead easy to set up), and it extends your wi-fi (which it does in two different ways - one very easy to set up, but of limited use, and one much more useful, but a bugger to set up).

As an internet extender, it's a wondeful product - mine works perfectly in the shed at the bottom of a 50m garden, with God knows how many connections/sockets/plugs inbetween the two ends. So, if you want to take the laptop down to the shed (or upstairs to the back bedroom) and plug it in to the extender with a bit of ethernet cable, it's a superb solution.

However, if you want to use your laptop over wi-fi, the picture is more complicated. You can configure these adaptors as wi-fi repeaters, which is very simple (just press a button on you router and another on the extender). But this only gives you a decent signal if your extender plug is close enough to the router to pick up decent signal itself. So, great for the next room, but not so good for the back bedroom - and my shed remains wi-fi free.

To get wi-fi from the extender plug itself, you have to configure it as a mini-router, and this is complicated (don't bother with the - very confusing - instructions, there is an excellent video on Youtube - the url of which Amazon won't let me give you!!). But it works - and wi-fi in your shed 70m away is yours for the having.

So far, so good (except for the rubbish instructions). But then you have to deal with the quality of the product itself. And here the picture is far from rosy. I was so impressed with the original extender (which came with the base plug), that I ordered a second one. However, this wouldn't work, so was sent back. Its replacement worked OK, so for a few weeks I had wifi in my shed, whilst my daughter could do her homework in her bedroom. (It very cleverly uses the same address and password as your router, so devices can switch from one to the other fairly seamlessly.)

But then both (BOTH!) units started playing up - providing intermitent wi-fi, or none at all. I reset both and followed the wonderful Youtube video once again - one came back to life, the other was fine with paired internet, but refused to do wi-fi. So now it's the daughter's homework or me listening to Radio Caroline in the garden. You can guess who won that one...

It's taken me a while to get round to sorting this out, so I'm beyond a reasonable time limit for returning the faulty unit (without a lot of fuss), and I don't know if it's worth trying a fourth one. Or maybe I should get a cheap router and plug it in the shed? (edit - this is what I did in the end)

Such a pity these are so unreliable, because, with better quality control (and much better instructions!) this would be a really ecellent product. But as things stand, all I can say is try it and see - but be ready to send it back if it doesn't work (and don't expect too much from the replacement). Good luck.",33

To set up, took around 30-45 minutes all in. The single sheet guide in the box is all you need.
It does recommend downloading their app to install - which I did. Once installed, the app has basically served its purpose as all the data on it is available through the web interface of the extenders (192.168.0.XXX).
The hardwired CAT-5 link works flawlessly in my wife's office. A speed test gives around very similar speeds to being directly connected to the main house router.
The Wifi extension upstairs also has a CAT-5 output, which I've tested successfully. But I use for the Wi-Fi only at present. It is okay and gives a strong signal out - enough for my daughter. I've ""cloned"" the main WiFi SSID (details on how to do this are in the box) which gives a basic mesh network in the house. However, I'm sure there is a clash with the main wifi, as some points in the house now give a lower signal. A simple switch on and off on my phone/tablet/laptop usually gets it to pick up the stronger of the signals - buts it's not seemless.

There IS an update coming to this set (AV600) that will give native mesh networking when used with a TP-Link router - but this hasn't been rolled out yet (July 2020).

Overall, I'm impressed. It's served it dual purpose brilliantly - and not bad for £65 at time of purchase,",3

Yes, it boosts your Wifi signal.
But, because it has the wrong country code (DE not UK) it will cause some MacBook owners to tear their hair out trying to fix an un-fixable problem with TPLink products.
They are German and so insist on their products having a german country code (DE), despite having stickers on the units saying UK.
This causes a problem on some MacBooks (including my MacBook Air) when, having connected to this router with the incorrect country code, you cannot re-connect to any proper UK country code routers. Google it and you'll see what I mean.
So if I connect to this TPLink device and then want to connect back to my UK BT Home Hub, I can't.
TPLink's 'support' just says their products have a German country code which 'shouldn't cause a problem'. Well they are wrong!

I think that’s about the end of the “Pros” for me. The Cons:

*The devices get quite hot, hotter than I would like.
*The connection is quite slow which is a problem for gaming and 4k content.
*switching is not seamless - they sort of work OK if you are Sat right next to one of them Not moving out of range of any other WiFi signal. If you are in range of another WiFi signal and especially you are moving they fail to switch smoothly more often than not. Unfortunately signal is now iffy in main rooms of my house where they cross over.
*unreliable in extensions - where I wanted signal the most the devices are quite unreliable and the light flashes every so often meaning no data for you. I presume they are quite fussy about how electrics are cabled.

I may keep the devices as this is the closest I’ve had to WiFi signal in my hard to reach rooms but worth their price they are not and reliable/seamless WiFi extenders they are not.",2

Initially these devices seemed a good choice. Unfortunately This device has two flaws that make it very annoying to use for me in my house.
1. Keeps dropping connectivity and needs to be restarted (sometimes twice a week) and the only places I could install these adapters are in difficult to get places, and when I have to reconnect it to the poer socket, its very annoying. That's despite newest firmware installed.
2. Interference on power cables. I have some analog audio equipment and noticed strange crackling and interference, turned out (after a long time tryign to find the fault) that it's caused by powerline using the same cables as electricity. Even simple analogue equipment is sensitive enough to be affected.
Pros:
- Easy to install and configure
- Has guest network
- App and web configuration methods.

Cons:
- Not very stable device (need to power cycle the devices like once a week or more often - albiet irregular)
- Interference for analogue audio equipment.

It does rely on you being able to hop from one base station to the next and provided they are in range all is well. Not cheap by any definition but does provide a single cohesive network for the whole house.

We recently renovated some outbuildings into workshops and garages and while this was wired from the main house the WIFI strength made the mesh extension option a bit risky as the signal that would need to be boosted was very weak.

I came across this product while researching alternatives and was pleased with the excellent reviews on Amazon and decided to give it a go as the cost was not prohibitive in any way.

Set-up was very easy and despite the instruction that you connect the base as close as possible to the router I found that the length of power circuitry was a more important factor. I tried ""the close to router"" approach but the WIFI station failed to pair. I had installed a Cat 7 ethernet system in the house when it was being built and had a number of ethernet ports in various locations to choose from. When the base station was relocated on a shorter spur to the main fuse board it paired successfully and provided a solid WIFi signal in the workshops.

The main connection into the house is 300 MBs and even though the signal delivered in the workshops is a fraction of that at about 12 to 20 MBs it is perfectly adequate for what we need.

The workshops are connected to the main house by a buried steel wire armoured cable and they have their own distribution board. I was pleased that the devices worked over this configuration and have no doubt that extending within a house on the same circuit would deliver considerably higher speeds.

Take it from someone who spent in excess of £600 for WIFI mesh systems that this much cheaper option, with the WPS integration, would provide an equally good solution. Highly recommended and excellent value for money.",1

It's great, it literally just plugged inro the wall and worked, improving my network connection massively when gaming. The WiFi extender left a lot to be desired though. I didn't really need it but I figured it might be handy for upstairs (where I sit in bed at night seems to be right on the edge of the routers WiFi capability). It basically sets a separate access point on your home network, with its own password and stuff, it's not a signal booster like I thought originally. Unfortunately it seemed to cause issues with my Sky home hub, network drop outs etc, requiring the router to be restarted in order to resolve. I didn't look too much into it but it seemed to fix itself when I unplugged the WiFi adapter and I've not had the issue since.

Setup was relatively simple. Pairing process is extremely easy and changing SSID and password is straightforward (and explained in instructions). So long as you are familiar with accessing your router settings you should be more than capable of setting it up.

Ethernet connection seems to work as well as if my pc were plugged directly into router. However, the broadband at my house is terrible (max 3Mbps), so I can't really comment on the 300Mbps claim. It also makes it harder to judge whether the powerline is at fault when my internet drops out.

The only issue I have had is the WiFi connection kept cutting out randomly for short periods of time. This was largely fixed with a firmware update for my router but still happens every so often and can be frustrating.

Finally, the only other minor thing I noticed was the included ethernet cables are cat5, which as far as I'm aware has a max speed of 100Mbps. So if you want the 300Mbps wired connection you will need to use your own cat 5e.

The big problem is that both the smaller trasnmitter and the larger receiver are built downwards from the plug. Maybe my house has plug sockets that are too low, but I haven't had problems with other electrical items plugged into the skirting boards. It was a tight squeeze to fit the trasmitter in the plug next to the main router and the transmitter is much smaller than the receiver. With the receiver it was very difficult indeed because the lower part of the unit pushes against the carpet. As you see from the photo, the unit is not actually properly pushed into the plug, but I already had to use a lot of force to get it this far. The only way I could have got it to fit properly in the plug would be to cut the carpet away underneath the transmitter! This problem could easily be avoided if the unit was built upwards from the plug point, not downwards. I can't believe they have never encountered this problem before. Very poor product testing. I am not happy with the safety of the transmitter as it is not fully into the plug, but I will have to live with it. Very annoying and unnecessarily dangerous too.",1

I was considering various options like running cables up the outside of the building, etc. but eventually after reading tons of reviews I opted for this solution. It's AWESOME.

CAUTION: We are lucky enough to be in a detached house so we know that the power rings are all ours - I have heard of problems before in semi-detached houses or flats with shared power rings but I can't really comment. My experience relates purely to a detached house.

Installation was so easy:
Plug the power-link hub device into a wall socket near my router
Plug the ethernet cable from router to power-link hub
Take one of the extender units and plug it into a wall socket elsewhere in the house (home office, in my case)
Press the sync button on the hub and then on the extender and watch them link up (took mine about 5 seconds)

At this point you now have an ethernet port in your new location.
Repeat for the second extender (we put ours at the top of the house, 3 floors)

Now you can connect to the web interface of the extender and change the wifi settings - making the network name and password the same as your standard internet connection means devices will seamlessly move between areas keeping strong wifi. The Wifi connection is 400mbs which is pretty fast, unfortunately the wired connection is only 100mbs (but there is a gigabit version, different product) but it is rock-solid.

I have had to restart the extenders a couple of times to re-sync them which is a bit of a pain but compared to running network cables everywhere it's better.

NOTE: I did first try another manufacturer's wifi-booster device which simply takes your existing wifi network and repeats it and it was massively lacking - if you have a large house and need a wifi hotspot creating, THIS is the product for you - it has transformed my working-from-home life :-)

I did research and found that it suffers from interference from other mains devices - Laptop chargers, phone chargers. Now I have to plug in a different room and not via an extension lead. Damn new houses - never enough sockets and never in the right place.  Original review:- in I already have a pair of BT Powerline network extenders so we can plug in the YouView box at the other end of the lounge. Since I have had to work from home I needed wifi coverage in my new office on the 2nd floor (3rd in Europe) but it was so weak it only worked in one corner. After checking the protocols of Powerline extenders AND powerline-based wifi extender (NOT Wifi Repeaters) I bought this TP-Link and was very satisfied it worked. The only thing I had to do was log into my existing Wifi access point and turn on the WPS temporarily. Then it was just one button press to pair the powerline part.... 5 seconds... done! Then WPS Wifi setup.... 10 seconds.... done. Relocate to my office and plug in. It just works, my Laptop now has super strong wifi signal and the throughput (Internet speed for dummies) is the same as connecting to the main modem/router via cable. Which for us here is just under 40Mbs. Super happy, OK its a bit expensive but better than buying a whole new setup.  The morel is, TP-Link powerline and wifi devices are compatible with the BT ones.",0

The 'sender' unit is compact, and the WiFi 'repeaters,' while larger, are not obtrusive. I placed one in my shed, and I now have a clear WiFi signal at the bottom of the garden, roughly 45 feet from the house. I have a really poor phone signal all through my garden, now the phone can stream my (admittedly dodgy) music choices on my decking.

I also placed one in an upstairs back bedroom, which is furthest from the router, which is downstairs and at the front.

Connecting the units together was very simple and worked first time. Next up was the ability to clone my security settings from the router across the TPLink... Again, it worked really quickly.

Even the app worked without a hitch, it's basic and I only wanted to rename the boxes, but it did it without a hitch.

I don't have a large house; the basic 3-bed semi, if that gives you an idea as to the ranges I'm talking about. I can even pick up my WiFi in my neighbour's garden.

So it works perfectly now .
My connecting never fails.

So from my experience WiFi is more reliable than these Powerline adapters unless you have them plugged into the same ring main - which kind of defeats the object.

Great price, cinch to set up, provides ethernet coverage perfectly too and seamlessly extends your WiFi coverage without all that unreliable extender nonsense.

But it has ultimately done nothing but frustrate and outright annoy me. Several times a day, the Powerline part loses sync with the master controller, dropping all internet access from the extenders but leaving WiFi working, thus leaving all devices happily connected but with no internet. On average this lasts a couple of minutes at a time and happens across all extenders. Sometimes it will do it several times inside an hour - I have to use WiFi calling in my house due to very poor network coverage. I have people on my call list I've called back 8-10 times in a single call! It cannot be relied upon in the slightest. As usual, switching the extender on and off resolves the problem instantly but by then it's too late, any call you're on, etc., is already dead and your blood pressure is rising.

I've ensured all extenders are plugged into the same house circuit and the TPplc app reports good connectivity everywhere. I've searched for firmware updates (there are none) but all I've found is a litany of people reporting the same problems. Lesson learned: do your research.

It's a bargain price but you sadly get something that is ultimately highly unreliable and thus unusable long term. It is not fit for purpose. I can only give it one star at best. I'm just going to have to swallow the loss and upgrade to one of the more expensive, higher-performing systems. And I won't be upgrading to a TP-Link one as I cannot trust their products any more.

I'm not a bot and I wasn't paid for this. I hope this makes this review more believable and if not - oh well. I don't review often/ever tbh but I had to write one for this. I'm going to attempt to write this in a way that helps non English readers easily translate the text so sorry if it's long:

It was difficult to decide which TP Link to choose since the prices and capabilities vary product to product. In the end, I went for the AV600 and it was a perfect choice. Easy instructions (take your time, do not rush), do as you are told and it SHOULD work (hopefully lol).

Don't let all the crazy sounding features of the pricier ones trip you up if you are not sure what to buy. For the average user of the internet; browsing, reading, streaming, downloading and even gaming is perfect with this. I have plugged my PS4 into my TP Link using an Ethernet cable and the speeds are fantastic. Low ping (around 15 - 25ms when playing Apex Legends) and download speeds 30 - 40Mbps (stats will vary depending on your ISP/Broadband provider, where you live, and so on).

I was uncertain if the WiFi on the AV600 was going to be any good but it is perfect - weirdly it is better than router. I chose to give up pass-through (i.e. being able to use the socket) for the WiFi functionality and the cheaper price. Well worth it - works perfectly with my phone and laptops. You will notice most of the TP Links with the pass-through option do not additionally offer the WiFi functionality (unless you spend a lot of money). Choose wisely.

If you have the money to spend, get the pass-through version that also has WiFi built in because it's less hassle in the long run. However, if you are like me and have plenty of sockets to spare and hate spending money, the AV600 will do just fine.

Life before this device was simply mediocre when it came to gaming, streaming and general internet usage - I thought my ISP was rubbish and all I needed was one of these.

I can not recommend this more.

I’ve tried WiFi extenders a long with other things but to no significant avail. I can’t compare this particular one to other Powerline Adaptors but it has made a significant impact to my PS4 gaming. I do still have some slight lag from time to time but isn’t a continuous problem as it soon rectifies. I 100% would recommend this product for anyone who struggles with lag during gaming (as that’s all I use it for) - it’s definitely better than WiFi extenders.Note: Make sure you use the Ethernet cables to connect from the power line extender to the PS4 otherwise you’re just using it like a WiFi extender.

I bought this hoping I could get wifi in a static caravan sited near the house.

For those who think this needs to be on the same circuit to work, it doesn’t, it will work beyond that.

I plugged the adapter in the BT router and power up. I then plugged in the extender in a socket near to the adapter and paired them as per instructions. The wifi network appeared and tested ok. I then move the extended to a different ring main in the kitchen, it worked the same. In each case the ‘powerline’ Led with lit steady.

NOW! This is the system the signal will have to get through, (This is the Live path, neutral less complex) {show approx distance} –

1. The Adapter in the house off a spur on a ring main {25m}

2. From there, inbound through consumer unit (cu1) RCD and Switch (sw) onto incoming mains

3. Now to a 2nd cu2 supplying and outbuilding. Outbound, through sw and RCD then into armoured cable {30m}

4. Cable enters building to cu3, through sw, RCD to ring main. {6}

5. Outbound from here leave goes to 32A caravan socket, then through 32A Flexible cable {20m}

6. Enters Caravan via 32A socket that connects to caravan cu4. {2}

7. This cu has 2 rings for sockets, a spur off ring 1 has a socket were the extender is plugged in {2}

I plugged the extender in this socket in the caravan and powered it up. Power led ok, wifi led ok, but powerline led flashes (before steady), this means signal low (not surprising!), however it worked fine. I tried streaming TV on a tablet and it worked brilliantly from anywhere in the caravan.

I bought this as a punt, not really thinking it would work, but it did! I guess TP-Link say “the same electrical circuit” knowing it should function ok like that. However this example proves that it’s better.
This may work for you, I guess it will depend on your own unique system and distances, you’d have to decide, all I know it worked for me.",0

It is first rate, with one qualification, that its not altogether obvious how to insert it into an existing network containing a wifi router and an existing set of powerline adaptors.To help anyone similarly puzzled this is how to do it.  You just plug in the TP Link.  It will then get a DHCP address from the router.  The effect will be that following the instructions and trying to log in via 192.168.1.1 will not work - it will take you to the router you already have.So you have to find out the address which has been assigned to this new device.  To do this you go into your router's admin interface.  Make a note of the address.  Then using a web browser go to whatever that is.Set up the TP Link with the same name and access password as your existing wifi.  I know, this is not very intuitive, but it works.  Devices which could only just connect to the router directly will now without further intervention connect to the LAN through the TP Link.  The effect is to make the signal several times as strong.  You shouldn't need to access the TP Link again, once its set up.  But if you ever do, the DHCP address may have changed, so you'll have to go through finding it out in the above way again.I had a lot of trouble with this until I decided to do it this way, and was pleased and a bit surprised to find that it worked so very simply.  The manual for my device doesn't make this at all clear.  It would be much better if it did, but once figured out, the thing is perfect.",0

Unfortunately I bought through an Amazon reseller rather than direct from Amazon. TP Link customer support didn't want to know as the reseller wasn't on their ""authorised list"". I thought they might honour the warranty - after all their product has failed and surely their reputation counts for something - but ""take it up with Amazon"" was the actual response.

The Adaptor connects to the modem via ethernet and transmits the ethernet signal over the house mains cables..  The Extender receives this signal and generates the appropriate Wi-Fi signal. Set up is straightforward. First the units have to be paired. This is done by connecting both to the mains. A multi-way mains block is useful for this. The pairing buttons are pressed and after a couple of minutes the lights indicate pairing is complete. The units can now be deployed as desired. (Please note that it is not advisable to plug either into a multi-way block for operational use. It is OK for pairing but both must be plugged into the same block. These blocks usually contain RF filters that will attenuate the signals that the extenders use. This is not helpful!). These units are particularly useful as the Extender unit provides not just Wi-Fi but a couple of ethernet sockets as well. It is possible to copy the SSID from your network to these units but I have not tried that. Additional Extender units can be added.",0

I was unable to get wifi in the conservatory. Plugged the extension in the main room adjacent to the conservatory, plugged in main unit and powered both up and pressed sync and they synced and then pressed wps on router and wifi button on the extender and had wifi in conservatory.

Plugged extender in garden room, wandered up to house and pressed sync on main unit, hurried back to garden room and pressed sync.

A few minutes later had wifi in garden room.

Painless and much easier than i was expecting so very happy and does what i need it to.

Wifi seems much faster, havent had the server unavailable error message as it times out.

Very pleased. Will see how long it lasts, has a three year warranty so hopeful.

Update, the conservatory proved a bit hit and miss so bought a second set. The pairing didnt work with the extender in the main room so i went to the music room and both paired without a hitch. I now have Full bars of wifi in the Conservatory and plugged the second unit into the garage where i can watch training videos and have a spare power unit should the original one go down.

He did not understand the whole tracing idea. I feel like there should be a little more of an introduction into writing. There are two pages for each letter of the alphabet and then practice pages for numbers. I really appreciate the section on handwriting strokes with straight and curvy lines, but there is only one page of straight lines and a couple pages of the others. I wish this section was bigger. I do not understand the purpose of the shapes tracing pages. My son can already draw shapes. If they are supposed to be helpful in learning how to form letters, put those first, and then the stroke practice, and so forth.",2

The personalisation options are pretty cool too, for no extra cost. A little simple, but what do you expect for free! The order was processed quickly and I received the email within 10 minutes that I could then print out. Assembly was pretty simple and there were clear instructions on how to redeem.

It is worth noting that this is a printable gift voucher. If you want an e-voucher, buy that option. This one is for you to print out and physically hand to the recipient.",5

"Victor M250S No Touch, No See Upgraded Electronic Mousetrap Black",Electronics,34.99,4.0,United Kingdom,2020-03-05,"I’d a problem with small rodents in both attics in my home. Ordinary traps were of no use. Bait was being eaten without setting off the traps and I was having no luck with catching anything. In my utility room I have dry dog food for my Alsatian, Rex. Rodents were travelling between the attics and the utility room to feast on kibble and return to the attic. I bought the Victor electronic trap and set it up. Two weeks later I caught a shrew. As it turned out the shrew was too small to catch in your typical mouse trap. So, all in all a victory. Usually, I would catch up to 6 mice per year in your standard mouse trap. I see the best set-up of typical mouse traps in addition to the electronic trap, to be ideal. Mice that are shy of standard traps, or smaller rodents (the shrew), are more likely to be trapped by the electronic trap. Provided you check, and empty, the electronic trap regularly, you should have no trouble with decomposition of a rodent in your trap. I give this electronic trap 4 stars!",0
"Victor M250S No Touch, No See Upgraded Electronic Mousetrap Black",Electronics,34.99,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-04-01,"We have had this make of trap before and required some more for a winter increase in mice indoors. These suckers never seem to fail. I have read plenty of mixed reviews but I just don't get it. Over a one week period 11 mice shuffled off this mortal coil and went to join their maker. I have now not seen 1 mouse or signs of since then. Think I might have got them!The good thing about these traps is that there is no scraping bits of mice off the traps or off the walls when they've been 'mushed' in a mechanical trap or the smell of decaying mouse when they've made it to a nice out of reach spot to die after being poisoned. The one thing I would say the BEST thing, by far, to bait these traps with is peanut. And I can say that the mice couldn't give a stuff if it's cheap, expensive, nutty, smooth or even organic.",1
"Victor M250S No Touch, No See Upgraded Electronic Mousetrap Black",Electronics,34.99,5.0,United Kingdom,2019-12-05,"A collection of mice moved into the shed and proceeded to tear into everything like an ageing rock star smashing up a hotel room.  The mess was indescribable, although I can try - they basically shredded almost everything and what the couldn't shred they used as a toilet.  Cleared all the mess out and wanted a trap that would be fast and humane, but which wouldn't muck about.  So, on a friend's advice, we got this ... baited with peanut butter and it works a treat.  Light didn't flash when making a kill though so still have to check daily but that's a good habit to get into - the only thing that smells worse than a live mouse's pee is a dead mouse.  No mess because it doesn't physically injured the mouse, just electrocutes them.  No idea on battery life yet as we've not had it long enough, but it does what it claims to, and to all mice in the area I'd just like to say You Have Been Warned - we're kindly folk but if you smash our shed up we're going to war.  Capice?",1
"Victor M250S No Touch, No See Upgraded Electronic Mousetrap Black",Electronics,34.99,4.0,United Kingdom,2019-12-10,"Mice in the attic is not something anyone wants to hear. We're kept awake every year in the lead up to winter by gnawing and scratching above our heads. Poison is usually effective but ultimately means that there are mouse corpses rotting away somewhere and not something I want.

I bought this, set it up and on the first night caught one of the little buggers. It's simple to use and clearly very effective at doing its thing.

Pros
- Effective at its job. No more partially murdered rodents dragging their sorry selves around in pain. Zap and done.
- No mess. Other traps can leave a real mess, snap traps can basically eviscerate/behead mice. We've had it and I'd rather not have it again.
- Easy. Whack in the batteries. Put the bait on the bait spot. Put it in area they run through. Turn it on.
- Quick clean/reload, no touching disease/lice ridden bodies. Open the top, empty into bin and repeat above (minus batteries)
- Pretty humane. It's sad to have to kill animals but ultimately live catch traps mean one of two things, they're coming back or infesting someone else's house depending on how far away you take them OR they are probably going to be attacked or vulnerable without a nest/knowledge of where food is out in the wild if they were born and raised in your attic in winter. Snap traps can do half a job and it's not pretty. This thing either works or they get a jolt, either way it's over quickly.
-The trap isn't going anywhere. With snap traps they can sometimes easily survive long enough to drag themselves and the trap behind kitchen cabinets/under fridges and be lost to rot away somewhere, plus you just lost your trap. With this they are not moving it anywhere.

Cons
- Even on offer it's kind of pricey. Decent snap traps can be picked up for pennies on the pound and you can have multiple traps going. £20 is not something you're going to double down on too much. This feeds into the next problem.
- Lack of repeatability. Once the trap has done its job it's out of action, in fact other mice will quite happily climb over its furry friend to steal the bait he/she was trying to get. This wouldn't be an issue if they were a bit cheaper so you could put multiples down but they are not. Frankly there really isn't any excuse for this price, the electronics inside can be found inside of poundland fly swatters and it doesn't even include batteries. Either make the trap a repeater (like the much more expensive and way overpriced big brother version of this one that costs about £50) or make it reasonable please, your brand name isn't *that* reputable. I hate to say it but mice are rarely alone and can breed like... well mice. Trap many or GTFO unfortunately.

Summary/TLDR

Would I buy it again? Probably. It works. It's effective. It's easy. It's less messy in multiple senses of the word.

However it is over priced and not really a practical option for dealing with an infestation, they will literally breed faster than you could kill and check traps in all but the most convenient locations. If you're not squeemish, have loose morals about killing vermin humanely or are on a budget just get a ton of snap traps/wildlife friendly poison and get the job done.

It’s pretty sturdy and even when stepped on my accident it held its own.,0

I used a pair of gloves to bait and set the trap as the leaflet advised to keep human scent off the device. Instead of using peanut butter as Victor advise I was encouraged to put a bit of Milky Way into the trap.

I used cooked chicken in the trap but next morning there was no mouse- although I saw it a few times during the day. Tried the trap with cooked sausage- still no luck. I added extra traps of the standard variety and was annoyed at spending so much on this trap.

I added peanut butter which I needed to buy specially- and TA DAAA- dead mouse!

I left the trap up for another day and TA DAA again- another mouse.

I’ve hired professionals, and used a plethora of traps, but I still see one or two scurrying around the kitchen, especially after midnight.This is by far the best trap I’ve ever used.  It is easy —  two AA batteries and fit the two chambers together and you’re ready.On the first day, it caught a mouse.  Later that night, the green light blinked, but it was empty.  I noticed I hadn’t joined the two chambers, which explained the false reading.  Next day, it caught two, at the same time!  Two days later, it caught another pair!  I’m shocked at how well and how efficiently this trap worked.The trap is also way more humane than the glue traps, which are cruel torture devices in my opinion.Five stars, we’ll earned.",3

I hated to do it, the little button eyes watching me like a friend waiting for my answer from under my tv shelf had me seriously considering how we might “share” the house...My dogs, dutifully posted at each hip on the sofa, looking at me like a traitor.Next morning cleaning up yet another trail o teeny turds had me starting the day a cussin, a long unflattering habit I’ve been trying to break...today will NOT be that day. It was as much the all night scratching chewing, otherwise joyful mouse happy sounds as that evening lil lady brought a gent home.  I didn’t even know they were dating. Well, She went all blitzkrieg on my clean drain board dishes on the counter while he ran recon on the floor in the kitchen RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME.  This degree of coziness had just exceeded decency.  The NEXT DAY these traps arrived.  I, willfully ignorant of all things digital, was able to set em...10 minutes I had my first adult, within 18hours catching 2 adults, 5 juveniles...they looked like they had just gone to sleep, not all mashed necks and bloodified bulging bits as with traditional, barbaric traps.Talk about SEEING!  And that’s IF it was a clean neck broken...grizzly and inhumane for the mouse & the unenthusiastic evictor.  These traps returned** Our home from “ A Little Mice Music” soundtrack all night long & restored to the peaceful sounds of Gods own music palette; the soft whir of an electric heater, flashing of the cooker clock I keep meaning to set yet never do.  That doesn’t actually make noise but it flashes so bright FEELS like a crashing sound should come along with it.  The best part~dogs snoring, and me, ‘’begging them for some space and a little blanket wouldn’t hurt, please, thank you,’’…Now guaranteed that that is in fact MY DOGS, & only my dogs mooshing  my hair & stealing my share of the blanket...PRICELESS.NOTE~to those who said mouse was sticking out...wow, might’ve been a rat.  Make sure your bait is wee and pressed into bait spot so the poor soul must go all the way in.  Be generous, it’s a last meal.  Hot dog worked well as did a shred of cheddar in a swipe of peanut butter....Didn’t have any trouble tilting them out into the compost...WASTE nothing.  Also NEITHER CRUEL LIKE A GLUE TRAP, Nor equally barbaric like the traditional (HIT finger while trying to set),  snap trap which is gruesome. Done with care, this trap is safer, quick and efficient....Hated to go that route...but when you juuuuust gotta, get this.",2
"Victor M250S No Touch, No See Upgraded Electronic Mousetrap Black",Electronics,34.99,5.0,United States,2020-01-04,"*UPDATE* Since my review just over a week ago, this trap has gone on to kill 5 more mice with the last 2 being at the same time (there were 2 small mice in there when I went to check it). This is still using the same 4 AA batteries I originally installed in it. On a side note, after every kill I use a Q-tip and rubbing alcohol to clean the metal contact plates just in case the mice are scenting as they die.When I bought this mouse killer I was skeptical and worried. Skeptical because it only needs 4 AA batteries to work and worried because of the reviews that stated it worked but only for the first mouse or that it could only kill big ones. That has not been my experience. It has killed 4 mice now in under a week. From a large one whose tail stuck half way out the back to one so small it was barely bigger than the large contact plate. When it's killing a mouse, you will hear it if you're in the same room. Just wait till the sound ends and the mouse will be dead. This trap is  way easier to use than the old spring loaded Victor traps we were using and we don't have to worry about the little one getting her fingers to set off the trap. Barring any future failure I may will probably buy another.",2

I have had this for almost a year. I ordered it because I already had the large rat-size version and had great success with that catching mice. I got the larger one first for my attic because I wasn't sure what species I needed to trap up there. Since that one kept catching mice (apparently rats were not my problem), I assumed the smaller one would be even better for mice. It's a waste of batteries. It actually did catch one tiny mouse early on. I cleaned it. And re-baited it with peanut butter. The light will flash, the buzzer will sound, but ... nothing inside. Ever. I have cleaned it many times over. It is not easy to get into the crevices to clean! And it not very easy to open up and check to see if there's a catch. I have other mousetraps -- the snap-trap kind -- around my very old house in a rural area; they all work with a vengeance. Same house, same peanut butter bait. So I guess I will just give up and throw this one away. The bigger one works well, but it's got a bigger footprint, so unfortunately, it isn't necessarily an ideal replacement.",2

I cannot manage the old fashioned wooden mouse traps. This totally avoids fingers being  snappped while baiting them. It eliminates the problem of other vermin, pets or animals being attracted to the odor before you  discover the kill (via the easy-to-spot blinking light aert).  I use the chumming technique of shark fishing. Once I determine a little customer frequenting a particular runway, drawer or other area, I sit the trap out for a few days NOT ACTIVATED YET, but FREE LUNCH the tiniest spot of  PEANUT BUTTER with a couple of sunflower seeds in it and maintain a quiet undisturbed atmosphere for his dining  pleasure. FINE LET HIM EAT. I refresh the goodies daily a few days,  then SET IT.  No need to gloat.

"Victor M250S No Touch, No See Upgraded Electronic Mousetrap Black",Electronics,34.99,5.0,United States,2020-02-18,"We have had a lot of problems with mice in our old apartment building, full of nooks and crannies and mouse-friendly passageways in the walls and floors.  I've tried many solutions over the years.  This works the best.Poison baits are effective, but the mice will end up decomposing where you can't find them, and the smell lasts for weeks.  Also a potential danger to our dog, and not exactly great for the environment.  Sonic or smell-based repellents work inconsistently or not at all.  Blocking holes doesn't do anything about the mice already here, and they find ways to tunnel through.  Reducing their food supply helps, but they are good at finding food, and unlikely you can starve them out.  I would never under any circumstance use glue traps.Within 48 hours of putting this trap in several different locations in our kitchen, it had killed six mice.  I take no pleasure in this.  But I think this is the most humane method available.  They die very quickly and quietly, not never knowing what hit them.  They do not seem to learn to avoid the trap.  There are no toxins.  There is no potential danger to dogs (maybe ferrets, but I doubt it).  You see the green light flashing, you open it up, dispose of the body.The battery placement is a bit awkward, but no major problem.  A tiny dollop of nut butter is more than enough to lure mice in.  The design means that they can't avoid the electric shock in time.  It is important to check the trap regularly, and clean it fairly often.  This is not hard to do.  I wouldn't rule out some populations learning to avoid them, but for the moment, I've found the best solution to reducing the mouse population.  And nothing is ever getting rid of them.  They'll definitely outlast us.",0

The green light only flashes every 30 seconds or so when one is caught, so you have to watch it; a quick glance won't work. Super easy to dispose of - open, upend, no touching of the filthy thing required. There are holes on one end so they can smell the bait. Don't cover the holes,  allowing them to eat the bait through the holes because it removes the motivation to go into the trap to get to it",1
"Victor M250S No Touch, No See Upgraded Electronic Mousetrap Black",Electronics,34.99,3.0,United States,2020-03-01,"Works fine -- caught two mice within days of starting to use it, exactly where I thought I'd catch them (to catch mouse #3--hopefully the last, I had to move it around to different locations).

However, this gets only an average rating from me because opening the trap portion (to add bait; remove dead mouse) was not easy, and separating the trap part from the battery part required a level of force that sometimes made me concerned I was going to break some crucial plastic bit.

Finally, as some others have commented, while this is a ""no touch"" method for trapping and killing, it's hard to imagine how it could be considered ""no see"" unless you are catching 1) very small mice and 2) willing to discard and replace the trap part of the device after every catch. With two of the mice I caught, the tail was very, very visible--extending outside of the compartment. Also, to open the compartment and empty it, you'd have to be very deliberate and attentive to not see the mouse either in the trap after opening it or after you dumped it into whatever container you empty into.",0

They just don't work. I even bought Duracell batteries to use so I know the batteries were all brand new and fresh. I baited the traps about 7 or 8 times and every time the green light would be blinking which indicates a kill supposedly, but the bait would be completed gone but no dead mouse inside.Evidently the voltage isn't high enough to kill mice or the mice aren't conductive enough to complete the circuit when they stand on the plates eating.

I inserted batteries after struggling to remove the trap from the functional part of the device. In addition to being difficult to separate I found that the cover for batteries kept coming coming off each time I struggled to reattach the trap part! It takes 4 AA batteries which it claims will last a certain amount of time but the only way you will know if batteries are no good is by turning the unit on and off, then the battery cover comes off again. I not only feel this unit is not effective I’m stuck with it because I can’t find the box! Take my advice pass on this unit!

We have been overrun in an old one-room farmhouse and bought three traps. One we baited with peanut butter in the little circle, and haven’t seen movement (in spite of mice running in that area) for two days. The second and third traps (ordered separately) arrived today and got set with a meat chunk from canned dog food. Worried about the mice being wary, we put a large chunk in each while it was turned off, waited a couple hours, checked and found teeth marks in both chunks. Cleaned the trap, reset with a piece of one chunk smashed all along the back wall (it sealed all the holes, but seemed like a good idea to have it all up the wall so they’d come in all the way, rather than the small bait dish at the bottom of the wall, where we worried our trap-defying pests could find a way to lift it and take off), and turned them on. Put them back in place and the next time we walked by - LESS THAN TEN MINUTES LATER - one had a flashing light.

The air filters are $25 a piece so this was a cost effective solution.  I had to replace the filters constantly because the urine smell is horrible and I don't want to turn on either the AC or heat and breathe all that bacteria.  I also didn't want them chewing up the wiring.  I live near oak trees and the acorns are everywhere, which is the primary food source for mice.  I have found acorns in my glove compartment.  I removed my glove compartment and got down on my knees so I could see the space behind it.  There was plenty of room to set this trap in one of the spaces.  So, I keep the trap in there year round.  Before I get in the car, I remove it (and empty any of it's dead contents) then I put the filter in place.  When I return home, I take out the filter and put the trap back.  This is gross but it gets the job done.  The batteries really last a long time.  Sometimes the mouse will pee when it gets zapped and you will have to TAKE OUT THE BATTERIES and then clean the trap or it might not work again.

The next day I look at but nothing. Then quickly it flashes red. I look closer and I see a tail. It works! Clean up was easy. The next day I hear another mouse in the living room. I set it out with no success. I set it up again the next night. This morning again light would intermittently flash green. So it was working but every once in awhile I would see a quick flash of red. My daughter wanted to use the batteries. When I turn it around, I see a tail coming out. It worked again! This mouse was bigger, so I had to do a little shaking to remove it.

You only hear it if it’s dead quiet, such as no fans, etc entire house off basically.  As far as no touch no see, it’s so-so on disposal of the mouse. You have to open the box and actively LOOK at the mouse and then dump them in the back 40 or garbage them. You don’t touch the mouse per se, but you do release them and by opening and dumping the box.  It’s not that big of a deal but if somebody must know, that’s the scoop.  Overall, I’m satisfied.

It caught mice on two consecutive nights, and I didn't even need to replace the bait.

The mousetrap doesn’t work at all. The lid of the trap doesn’t close very tightly, and so a tiny house mouse was able to open the top twice and eat the bait without being shocked.

Also, the area with the bait has holes to allow airflow, but that doesn’t lead the mouse into the trap— it just attracts the mouse to the holes, which it then gnaws at.

I bought this product because it was on a big discount, but don’t fall for it. The trap doesn’t work at all. I’m returning mine—don’t make the same mistake I did.

I have three of these traps now. I can't recommend them more. They do the job and you don't have to worry about any little fingers getting injured in them. We used to put out all the conventional flip traps at night after the kids when to bed and then remove them all the following morning. A big hassle! We just leave these electronic traps out all the time.

The traps occasionally catch a roach. The shock does not kill the roach, but incapacitates it such that it's pretty easy to deal it a last blow. Nonetheless, finding a live roach in one can be disconcerting. It would be better if the top were clear plastic so you could see what's in there before opening. Nonetheless, I love these traps.

Occasionally the light on the top will not be flashing even though there is a dead mouse in there. It's best to check it once every few days even if the light isn't flashing.

I can't stand the noise and mess of other options, and this is both quiet and tidy. Just a couple quibbles: 1) the blinking light can be hard to spot since it's so slow. 2) the ""no see"" disposal marketing is not so much my experience - the beveled chamber does a great job of trapping cleanly, but especially with bigger mice, the bodies sometimes get too wedged in it to dislodge easily - I'm using plastic tongs to lift them out by the tail -- and yes, you'll sometimes see those tails sticking out of the opening.

I recently had some mice in my apartment -- old pre-war building -- and the old-fashioned spring-loaded traps I also set caught a number of mice, but this electronic device caught nothing, even with the same bait.

I am guessing that the scent holes on this trap aren't large enough to release enough bait scent to lure rodents.

Who knows? So the old-fashioned spring-loaded traps are probably still the best way to catch mice, for those of us without cats in the house...",0

I was, at first, expecting the sound of the shotgun to be almost completed muffled but this was not the case. You can hear the shot very clearly but not at all deafening. Almost as if it was a shotgun fired from some 100 feet away. As the sound waves hit the ear defenders it instantly turns down the volume, which is only noticeable as the regular volume returns after the shot. On a still day these work perfectly but on a windy day you will need to turn the volume down, otherwise you will get a lot of wind noise as it passes over the microphones. But even with the volume turned down, surrounding sound can still be heard. For the price, they are a bargain. More expensive ear defenders may do a better job but at this price you can’t grumble. And most of the time you are only paying for the brand name.",0

These babies are fantastic because they have the volume control which allows LOUD noise to be blocked and voice noise to be heard!!!
Not too pricey but well made and came with their own case.
Have to say that I rarely use the case as its simpler to set the muffs in my gun bag.
Batteries last well and the muffs shut themselves off if you forget to close them down afetr a range session.

I loved the idea of this headset!! To be able to choose the level of volume I hear, plug into my phone/tablet or Xbox controller to listen to music/shows or games and to have his screeches trigger the noise cancellation feature was perfect, If it worked. It didn't. When not turning the set on it does muffle sound but not near enough for screams. When turning the set on there's a near constant static sound that you can almost control by holding your head at bizarre angles (bad wiring) and then the noise canceling feature never seemed to trigger. I even used a device to see how loud my son was during an episode and it definitely is more than the 80 something decibels that's suppose to activate noise cancellation... plus add to the fact that you have to have the volume amplifier turned on to use that magical function, the screams are now amplified.Great product idea but either the poor construction or flat out false claim of a noise cancelling feature makes this buy bitterly disappointing.",0

I’ll update this review as soon as they make some kind of contact with me, or I receive the gift that was promised.**I bring these with me to the range every time that I go, and love them. I can keep them on the whole time and carry normal conversations, and they completely cancel the noise of every shot.

Actually building the robots is also difficult. Fitting some of the bits together is A LOT harder than Lego.

We've tried a couple of the builds and the whole thing is so temperamental they don't seem to.work reliably (if any of the bits catch or stick then it won't work).

"TC Electronic DITTO LOOPER Highly Intuitive Looper Pedal with 5 Minutes of Looping Time, Analog-Dry-Through and True Bypass",Electronics,nan,1.0,United Kingdom,2020-03-28,"I wanted a looper to replace the cheap one that I had been using and having watched various demos and reviews, I opted for the Ditto. I was very disappointed to find that when the looper was engaged no signal was able to pass through it to the amp - in other words I could not hear what I was playing, either the backing track or any overdubs.The looper did however record everything and was able to play  back everything with the excellent sound quality that I wanted - but if you can't hear what you are playing it's not much use.Reference to the internet suggests that this is a fairly common problem which doesn't say much for TC's quality controls, especially as this is supposedly a premium product with a premium price tag.I decided to take a chance and return the product in exchange for another one and guess what? The replacement had the same problem! Seems as if there was a dodgy batch - beware!",3
"TC Electronic DITTO LOOPER Highly Intuitive Looper Pedal with 5 Minutes of Looping Time, Analog-Dry-Through and True Bypass",Electronics,nan,4.0,United Kingdom,2019-12-31,"This is my first loop pedal. It's been a real education as to the sloppiness of my playing!

To get good loops the first loop you lay down needs - if it's a normal type of music (ambient soundscapes, for example, might be more forgiving) - to be perfect. Subsequent layers of overdubs can be added, and the start-stop timing of these is less crucial. But the relative timing/tightness remains important. I'm finding that my four or five part rhythm tracks - emulating bass and several rhythm guitar parts, etc - are, at present, way too sloppy.

My hope is that this pedal will enable me to get better at the execution and layering of these parts, such that I'll then be able to create decent loops over which to practice scales and soloing, and even to drum along with. As a musical tool it's terrific, even if it's a bit depressing initially in highlighting my shortcomings.

So why just four stars? Well, as far as I know you can't store - other than retaining the current loop you're working on, by leaving the pedal on - your loops. And you can only undo the last loop you overdubbed. And if you accidentally hit record again after a duff loop, you can't get back to the previous one. More expensive loop pedals have more of such functionality. And you'll quickly see why folk want these options. I want them already!

But as a first loop pedal this is an excellent device, which - despite its limitations - I'd heartily recommend.

UPDATE: I've discovered that the Ditto Looper does in fact store the last/current loop, even if power is cut to the pedal, when I accidentally did the latter.",6

"TC Electronic DITTO LOOPER Highly Intuitive Looper Pedal with 5 Minutes of Looping Time, Analog-Dry-Through and True Bypass",Electronics,nan,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-01-12,"What’s not to like about this pedal? It looks good, sounds good, fits easily on your pedalboard, and importantly - it’s simple to use. Not only this, but the countess hours of fun you can get from a pedal like this is totally worth the money.

The Ditto Looper records your playing and loops it back at a 24-bit audio quality which is uncompressed. As result, the audio that is being looped doesn’t sound worse in terms of audio quality than what you may be playing over the top of the loop. I have found that the more layers you add to a loop also doesn’t seem to affect the audio quality. You can distinguish the different layers you have added to your loop, and fortunately it doesn’t become a distorted mess. The pedal also doesn’t colour your sound when playing through it, as TC Electronic claims. Additionally, the pedal can loop up to five minutes of audio, which is very generous and likely more than you’ll normally need, but it gives you more possibilities, and you can recreate entire songs in a single loop.

As for the controls, there is the “Loop Level” control which controls the volume of the loop audio, and there is also the switch which is responsible for controlling everything else. The switch relies on different simple commands you give it to control the pedal. For example, a single click to start or stop recording, or double click to stop playback of your loop. A nice feature is that you can erase mistakes that you make my holding down the switch, which deletes only the previous layer you recorded.

The LED light has good brightness and makes it clear what the pedal is doing. For example, the light is red when recording, green when playing back a loop which flickers when the loop restarts, and the light flashes green when the loop is paused.

So, are there any downsides to this pedal? There are, but they’re probably not enough to stop you from buying one, and they won’t apply to everyone. Firstly, there are a lack of features compared to some other loopers with drum machines and other effects built in. But, for some people like me this is a positive as it keeps things simple, and also keeps the price and size of the pedal down. You can always add your own separate effects anyways if you have them in your effects loop. Also, the fact you have to double click the switch to stop the loop may be too slow or awkward for some that are using in a live environment. Lastly, if you want to add a new layer at the start of the loop when the loop is in standby, you cannot start recording straight away as soon as the loop is restarted. You have to wait a moment before you can press the switch again (otherwise it will register as a double click and stop the loop again). Normally you’d keep the record feature on past the end of the loop, but if you’re changing tone or effects (which takes time) you may have to wait until the loop is finished, then start recording again.

Overall, a looper is one of the most fun pedals you could get and you can’t go wrong with this one. Highly recommend! Hope this was helpful.",5

"TC Electronic DITTO LOOPER Highly Intuitive Looper Pedal with 5 Minutes of Looping Time, Analog-Dry-Through and True Bypass",Electronics,nan,1.0,United States,2020-05-21,"This product simply doesn’t work. Don’t buy this from Amazon. Mine worked for about an hour. I am concerned it came broken out of the box. It was sold and shipped by a company called Amazon.com Services LLC. When I recieved it I was stunned to feel something banging around inside. I opened it and discovered a small box inside the large box, with no packing materials at all! Please see attached photo. This is a piece of sensitive electronic equipment, not a plastic jar of Lysol wipes! Why would some lazy creep just throw my purchase into a larger box with no padding? Is it because he’s pissed that Amazon refuses to allow its worker to unionize and snuffs out the slightest hint of labor organization with a ruthless internal corporate hit squad? Is it because Bezos the richest man in the WORLD forced him to keep working for minimum wage when co-workers all around him were dying of Covid-19? This was an epic fail. I owned a TC electronics Ditto looper and and I loved it. It lasted me 5 years before it started to fail (the failure of these things comes on quickly—pedal presses suddenly don’t work and you have press repeatedly before it responds. Also the output fails to send a recognizable signal to the amp until you unplug and re-power everything, and the signal develops intermittent static).  But my old Ditto worked perfectly for 5 years. I thought it would be a no-brainer to just buy a new one and be good for a long time. Not so. I am very angry. I waited (in isolation) SO long for this thing, checking the mail every day, and it FINALLY arrived (very late), and then it litterally fell apart in my hands. Not sure if TC Electronics has taken a huge dive in quality or if the culprit is Amazon Services, LLC, but you would be a FOOL to buy this product, especially from this vendor! Here are a few other things that sucked about this product: if you are planning to play on battery, the battery compartment is unwieldy and requires you to always have a screwdriver in your kit and deal with a fussy little screw that can easily get lost. The backwards feature and the 1/2 speed feature are just kind of stupid. Not musical. Hard to see anybody making much use of them in performance, unless they just play boring one-chord jams, and even then it will be a struggle. I predict 95% of people will just keep that button set to STOP all the time. Finally, the price. WTF? 200 bucks. Close to double the price of the competition for a pedal that is heavier and has dumb extra features you won’t use and doesn’t work on the first day you own it. Just a fail.",10
"TC Electronic DITTO LOOPER Highly Intuitive Looper Pedal with 5 Minutes of Looping Time, Analog-Dry-Through and True Bypass",Electronics,nan,4.0,United States,2019-12-24,"I have used this pedal every day for four years. It has performed well except for this last week. The output level has shifted. One day it came out at a lower volume than normal. Followed by a few more performances of accurate output. Last night’s performance output came at a level below normal again.  Historically, TC Electronics fail on me, however, I do not see a better option for sound quality, and will by this again.  I’d like to buy Ditto x2 for the dedicated stop button, however, I am afraid that more electronics in it means more chance for the equipment to fail.",0

Oz. 15Yr Guarantee - Silver",Electronics,nan,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-05-29,"These scales are excellent - solidly made and appear to be accurate.
However, when you get them, the instructions are a bit incomplete.
As you can see from my picture, it states ""Remove battery isolator tab (if present)"" then in a second sentence suggests inserting batteries the correct way round.
Generally, anything that has a battery isolator tab sticking out of a screwed down battery cover is a tug and go, but not this. If you tug on the isolator tab, it actually pops the battery out of the battery holder, you then have to find a tiny little Phillips screwdriver, open the battery cover, and re-seat the battery in the holder you just tugged it out of (or do what I did first time round, pull tab, find it's not working, send back to Amazon for a replacement...).
Maybe I'm a bit dim, but it wasn't very obvious to me that the isolator tab sticking out, waiting to be tugged, as per the instructions, was actually waiting for you to unscrew the cover, remove the cover, then tug the tab to unseat battery, then re-seat battery, ensuring that it's the correct way round :)
NOT a complaint, jut a little heads up should you buy these wonderful scales and be a bit dim like me :)",11

You pull it out. Then switch it on. Except it won't switch on. You realise you have to unscrew the tiny screw for the battery compartment cover since pulling the plastic tab pulls out the battery, so you have to fix it into place.

Therefore, if you want a quick fast service, bear in mind we all don't have little watch screwdrivers lying around, and want an easy pull out of the box product. So if you're buying this, make sure you have a (very tiny) straight screwdriver handy, else you can't use it right away.

Oz. 15Yr Guarantee - Silver",Electronics,nan,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-01-06,"When I first got these scales I wasn't sure about the accuracy. I've had another set of digital scales that I use mostly for postage and product weights, but I wanted something smaller for the kitchen. To calibrate my old set I have a 100g and 200g weights, so I tried them on these and they are spot on. So having satisfied myself to the accuracy I went about my baking using them.

A tip with the battery change. I found that if you have the battery housing at the top of scales as you look at them, you will see to metal protrusions just below the battery. If you squeeze these together the battery pops out easier. I had trouble getting the isolating strip out from under the battery until I did this.

Using them is a breeze. Changing between imperial, metric and mls couldn't be simpler, just keep pressing the button until you get what you want. I love the fact that you can zero out after adding each ingredient so you save using lots of different containers and save washimg up. So that makes them environment friendly to. And switching between dry weight and wet. I do have one bowl that is a little large for these scales in that it blocks the display when looking down , so I have to bend a little to see it. I wanted compact so I'll live with it.

Oz. 15Yr Guarantee - Silver",Electronics,nan,1.0,United Kingdom,2020-05-10,"Bought last week, wanted to use straightaway but when I got home, the scales wouldn’t switch on and I couldn’t get at the battery compartment because it’s secured by what is apparently a (really tiny) Phillips 00 screw.

I don’t have a screwdriver this size, and don’t see why I should buy one just for this, so the scales are going back.

According to Salter Customer Services, this ‘feature’ was added a couple of years ago so that kinda couldn’t get at the battery. However, the poor design means it will be much more difficult for anyone with reduces mobility/grip to use, and also means that you need to buy the screwdriver with the scales unless you already happen to have one of these at home (maybe if you are a jeweller, or into electronics).

Rather than inflict this design on everyone, they could have added a large, clear warning dor parents, and perhaps packaged the screw separately so that at least the scales would be usable from the outset (and people could decide whether to bother with it at all).",2

The display goes funny, then Lo then completely off. Apart from the nuisance of having the scales cut out mid-weigh when it's not possible or convenient to go out to the shops and I have no more spares, the batteries are expensive and I certainly won't be buying any more, so the scale is now useless to me. For what it's worth, the battery chamber s ridiculously designed for changing the batteries, plus the scale marks easily on the weighing platform and the surround and doesn't clean easily. When it works, the scale does weigh accurately. but I'm now looking for an accurate manual scale - or perhaps one that plugs into the mains if there is such a thing and it's affordable.",1

TC Electronic Dark Matter Distortion Pedal,Electronics,37.99,3.0,United Kingdom,2020-06-13,Great sounds but flawed design..the distortion only engages when you release the footswitch.. which means if you go quiet to loud you'll be a 1/16 note behind the rest of the band..ok for always on or bedroom guitarist though,0
TC Electronic Dark Matter Distortion Pedal,Electronics,37.99,4.0,Canada,2019-12-23,"If you ever decide to go the Left Hand Path and swim across the Ever Flowing Stream, this is the pedal you will need. With the outrageous prices of old Boss HM-2’s in the used market, the Eyemaster is a solid alternative.

As far as the tone goes, there is no subtlety at all. What you get is the infamous Sunlight studio buzzsaw aural assault, nothing less. I’ve owned many MIJ and Taiwan Heavy Metal pedals, and the Eyemaster is a strong contender. Before spending your life savings on an old beat-up Boss HM-2 or a high-end boutique clone, give this pedal a try. The Eyemaster seems strurdy and built to last, the enclosure is anything but cheap. Knobs feel tight, and the click-less switch is a nice feature too.

A master eye is the eye
Able to behold
And part truth from lie
In what it's been told",3
TC Electronic Dark Matter Distortion Pedal,Electronics,37.99,4.0,Canada,2020-03-06,"The Dark Matter has been on my pedalboard for about 2 years. It sounds quite nice and I generally use it for a mid-level gain sound. The name of this pedal is somewhat misleading, as it is not a high-gain, dark-sounding pedal. Instead, it is great for some light power chords or making a solo stand out.

Build quality is alright, but nothing spectacular. The switch on the top of the pedal does feel inexpensive, and likely wouldn’t last under heavy usage.

Overall, it is a nice sounding pedal, but it is not perfect and likely won’t stay on my board much longer.",2
TC Electronic Dark Matter Distortion Pedal,Electronics,37.99,5.0,Canada,2020-01-29,This is a great HM-2 copy with both EQs dimed which is the only way to use this pedal. I have a MIJ HM-2 and the Behringer HM300 and both sound similar. The major difference I found with the Eyemaster is that the gain control has more range. I get a great chainsaw at about 3 o’clock on my 5150 instead of dimed. It’s a great pedal but only does the chainsaw.,0
TC Electronic Dark Matter Distortion Pedal,Electronics,37.99,5.0,Canada,2020-01-03,"I bought this pedal to use in front of a Bugera g5 with a 1x12 celestion-V semi-open-back. Putting it through the clean channel, it was ok. It's got a decent middle of the road rock tone on its own and if you're putting it through a transparent tone to emulate an old plexi, it should do the job for relatively little $. But I didn't buy it for mid-road rock. I bought it for metal.

When I gain stacked it with the overdrive channel of my g5, the whole setup came alive. It stacks easily and beautifully with the g5 preamp and gives me anything from a classic metal tone, to tight thrashy tones, to death metal liquid saturation. I'm not sure its the right pedal to play djent with, my Mojomojo might be better for that. It might do djent if I dial just the right gains and EQ in, but even if it doesn't do djent perfectly, its a great addition to my collection and I don't regret the purchase.

This pedal also has some great options that give you alot of flexibility in tone sculpting. I find its just enough, combined with my amp tone stack, to give me plenty of flexibility, without getting frustrated at having too many options.

My only complaint is that it doesn't sound nearly as good as my amps overdrive channel when compared on their own. But honestly, how can I really call that a downside that a $70 pedal doesn't sound as good as a $400 tube amp.

Honestly, I'm in love with TC right now because whether you're on a budget, or just looking for something to spice up an old tube rig, they have some very solid, very versatile, great sounding stuff.",0
TC Electronic Dark Matter Distortion Pedal,Electronics,37.99,5.0,Canada,2020-05-05,This pedal gives me the plexi sound that I like without the excessive gain of modern day Marsha__s. Beauty of this pedal is that you can get that over-dirt distortion all the way down to behaving more like a boost pedal. Very dynamic and musical...a good deal,0
TC Electronic Dark Matter Distortion Pedal,Electronics,37.99,5.0,Canada,2020-03-11,"I was pleasantly surprised at how quickly I could dial in ""Eric Johnson"" distorted tone using this device. I had seen a YouTube video recommending it and it works very well. Glad I made the purchase.",0
TC Electronic Dark Matter Distortion Pedal,Electronics,37.99,5.0,India,2020-01-26,The distort is really heavy and perfect for playing heavy metal or trash metal solos. The tone suits Friedman style distort too! For the price it's something a pro guitarist must definitely have.,1

TC Electronic Dark Matter Distortion Pedal,Electronics,37.99,4.0,United States,2020-01-12,"Pros:
By itself it can pull off hard rock tones and early metal. Definitely a fun pedal.
Sounds great paired with the TC Electronic Rusty Fuzz. With the Rusty Fuzz in front of this distortion its easy to get bit-crusher type fuzz sounds or that overloaded tube amp icky thump fuzz.
Hookups are all in the back so you can put pedals right next to each other for a tidy look.

Cons:
All of the smorgasbord of pedals line are bigger than your typical boss sized pedal, so if pedalboard real estate is at a premium you might consider a DS-1 instead.
Doesn't quite take you into ultra-high gain pinch harmonic territory without a boost in front of it.

Overall:

A great sounding affordable and well-constructed pedal good for hard rock and early metal distortion. The tone isn't as shapeable as more expensive pedals like the BE-OD (which costs 3x as much).",4
TC Electronic Dark Matter Distortion Pedal,Electronics,37.99,5.0,United States,2019-12-06,"I've been a fan of the Mojo Mojo OD for a number of years.  I read somewhere that this was similarly versatile, and not simply a ""Rat clone"" as I'd previously thought.How true that is.  This pedal has a different flavor of dirt than the Mojo, but you get a lot of tonal variety with the bass/treble controls, and it will do anything from a clean boost to pretty raunchy hard rock distortion that will clean up - but not totally - with your guitar's volume knob.  Really impressive, and an insane value.  I've never had an issue with a TCE pedal.  If this broke I'd buy another.  Really much, much better than I expected.  I think I like it better than the Mojo.",5
TC Electronic Dark Matter Distortion Pedal,Electronics,37.99,5.0,United States,2020-01-03,"Typically, I run a strat into a Blues Driver into a Blues Jr. OR a Katana, on the Clean channel, set to sound like a Blues Jr. I keep my amps clean, and use the Blues Driver to give me just a bit of grit for when our set goes from clean funk to a bit of blues. I needed a pedal to hit for some killer lead tones.

THIS THING DELIVERS.

Now normally, I would put that lead-tone pedal before the Blues Driver in the chain, to preserve some of the tonal quality of the Blues Driver. A DS-1 works well here. I've played that for a while. I've also just stacked another Blues Driver, one with higher gain.

But the Dark Matter didn't work there for me. I ended up putting it AFTER the Blues Driver, and I really like it there. I think with a pedal like the DS-1, it's got pretty transparent gain, so using it as a boost to an overdrive like a Blues Driver makes sense. But the Dark Matter is a very different beast from the DS-1. It's creamier. It's breakup sounds more organic, less mechanical. If I strum a chord with both the Blues Driver and Dark Matter on, you can still hear the individual notes.

This thing doesn't do the cranked-up fuzz tones of a Big Muff or even an OCD. It's not a RAT. It's its own thing, for sure. But for <$50, it's a steal. I'm sure I could set the gain low and use this, instead of a Blues Driver, to color my tone into a clean amp. It's a neat little pedal for sure.",1
TC Electronic Dark Matter Distortion Pedal,Electronics,37.99,4.0,United States,2020-02-07,Is this pedal gonna blow your mind? Hell no. It’s a pretty basic distortion pedal with what I find to be a very shallow sound. It just sounds like it’s missing some lows and mids compared to my other pedals. And the volume knob works on an exponential curve. But. For the price. It’s an amazing deal,0
TC Electronic Dark Matter Distortion Pedal,Electronics,37.99,5.0,United States,2020-01-08,"I had very low expectations on this pedal because the price seemed too good. I haven't tested it with my tube amp yet, but on my Marshall digital double stack it rips. A quality distortion that doesn't lose pitch. You won't find a better value for a pedal that sounds this good. You can get depth, punch, and sharpness really well from this.",1
TC Electronic Dark Matter Distortion Pedal,Electronics,37.99,4.0,United States,2020-01-22,"This is basically like being able to tweak every possible setting on an old Marshall. '70s guitar rock crunch. Not much bottom end out of it at all, but sounds great and huge with an overdrive in front of it.",0
TC Electronic Dark Matter Distortion Pedal,Electronics,37.99,4.0,United States,2020-03-20,"If your guitar sound involves pushing a cranked amp with some overdrive to make it distort more, this isn't really going to be your thing. However, if you just use a clean pedal platform, or are recording direct, this produces a great, crisp distortion. I didn't find EVERY combination of settings usable, but this did give me some searing lead tones when recorded directly into a preamp.",0

My weightloss regime requires me to weight daily so that an average can be calculated. However in the last 17 days.. I have no fluctuated by even 100g apparently. Every day I weigh I weigh the same. Which is definitely not correct or accurate. Also when displaying as Stone and Lb the display is very difficult to read as the sections of the number that are supposed to be hidden to give you your reading, as with all digital clocks, those parts are still faintly there meaning you have to hold the scales at a shallow angle just to be able to read the display. Not practical at all. If it wasn't for the fact that I am currently shielding I would return these scales as faulty. However cannot get to a drop off to return them so now I'm stuck with them.",0

On this occasion, after seeing the positive reviews I decided to give this model a shot and I can confirm it's the bees knees.

Whilst you do need the proprietory app it syncs nicely with Apple Health to allow it to spread your health ecosystem.

It looks great in a light bathroom and is incredibly easy to use (step on, it then weighs and syncs with your phone (with app open) and then step off).

Even worse, they break where the plastic joins the brass and it's impossible to remove them without a drill. Not exactly child-friendly.

"Ring Stick Up Cam Elite by Amazon, HD Security Camera with Two-Way Talk, Black, Works with Alexa",Electronics,nan,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-02-26,"The Ring cameras are fantastic, no problems at all. I paid for my cameras to be installed via amazons installation service but, that is because I'm disabled. I would have easily fitted these myself if I was still able-bodied.I spent quite a bit of time doing my own research before opting for these Ring cameras, and I will share my knowledge if it helps. I'm with Sky as my ISP (Internet Service Provider) I only pay for 37 MBPS in speed. After doing my research on Wi-Fi mesh networks I decided to opt for the BT Whole Home Wi-Fi Triple Pack (which you can buy from amazon for £161.98) I didn't think they were overly expensive and It nearly doubled my speed up to 75 MBPS! The big bonus with these BT Wi-Fi discs is they work with any ISP (Internet Service Provider) be it Sky, Virgin, BT etc. There is also an Ethernet port at the back of each disc which means hard-wiring your Ring cameras via PoE (Power Over Ethernet) an absolute doddle. If you want a stable service and great picture with your Ring cameras you have to go PoE in my opinion instead of wireless. Only one of the discs has to be plugged into your router via Ethernet the other two you can move around your home to boost your signal. I live in a 2-bed bungalow and everything is working great for me but, I've also read many comments from people who live in houses who have purchased these discs, and they work great for them too.The Ring cameras are fantastic, and getting the app for them via the play store for your phone or tablet is easy and free! The same goes for getting the app for your laptop from the Microsoft store for windows. I took out the monthly plan for the Ring cameras the same day great service all round.",4
"Ring Stick Up Cam Elite by Amazon, HD Security Camera with Two-Way Talk, Black, Works with Alexa",Electronics,nan,4.0,United Kingdom,2020-06-06,"I have several ring cameras, this seems to be the worst of them.  Firstly the picture in daylight is good quality when it switches to night vision it looses quality and you would struggle to make out the face of a person at 5 meters.  every so often the video feed stutters and takes a few seconds to update so you can see multiple images on the screen.  The is a built in intercom that should allow you to talk to the person on the camera this is not usable as the audio is broken both ways.  This is hardwired to a 500mb Virgin connection with the POE adaptor supplied and I don't get the same issues on the Ring doorbell or Ring spotlight camera which connect VIA wifi to the same network.",0
"Ring Stick Up Cam Elite by Amazon, HD Security Camera with Two-Way Talk, Black, Works with Alexa",Electronics,nan,1.0,United Kingdom,2019-12-23,"I'm really disappointed. The 1st unit purchased was faulty (the WiFi died after 24 hours), and because set up requires WiFi I couldn't even set the device up using an ethernet connection! Second device came quickly and worked fine (thanks to Amazon for the quick returns procedure). My main issue is that I had wanted to set the camera up as a nursery camera for when our toddler is asleep. However, LIVE VIEW IS RESTRICTED TO A MAXIMUM OF 10 MINUTES. What kind of security camera does not allow a permanent viewing connection? I assumed that this setting could be changed, however it's hard coded which is ridiculous. Needless to say, I'm extremely disappointed that this security camera cannot be used as a security camera.",4
"Ring Stick Up Cam Elite by Amazon, HD Security Camera with Two-Way Talk, Black, Works with Alexa",Electronics,nan,3.0,United Kingdom,2020-04-23,"Bought this camera on offer to test out ring cameras before deciding to buy more.

Pros
Ring app is very good
Motion detection is spot on, you can’t fault it.
Working with echo devices and the Alexa platform is brilliant.

Cons
Quality of footage isn’t the best and i thought looked a little blurry
Subscriptions are not ideal considering the price of the camera
Privacy is a massive concern with ring at the moment.

Overall although I liked the fact it worked well with my echo devices the footage quality and privacy concerns have made me decide not to buy any other ring products

I have decided to invest in eufy due to their 2k video quality and the local storage their devices provide.

Ring aren’t the best but certainly are not the worst. I think they offered a local storage product and improved the camera footage I would consider moving over to them in the future.",0
"Ring Stick Up Cam Elite by Amazon, HD Security Camera with Two-Way Talk, Black, Works with Alexa",Electronics,nan,4.0,United Kingdom,2020-06-24,"Pros -
- Power over ethernet with an included PoE injector if you're connecting to a standard ethernet network. This gives a responsive and reliable connection. Genuinely, everything is in the box - drill bits, screwdrivers - Ring have done a good job here. There's even a spare micro-USB power supply if you want to use it via WiFi - but why would you?
- Uploads to Ring's cloud only occur after motion detection. If, like me, your fibre service is just fibre-to-the-cabinet VDSL (aka BT Infinity 1/2, Sky Fibre, Vodafone Superfast etc) - your upload speed is rather precious. I have 44Mbit/sec down and 6.8 Mbit/sec up. Google's Nest cameras and doorbells constantly stream to the Cloud; thus Ring's solution provides me the right balance between physical security and the capacity of my fibre broadband connection. If you've got full fibre with circa 30Mbit/sec upload or better, then you might well be happier with a constant stream.
- Motion zone support is very useful and simple.

Cons -
Google Assistant's Ring support is universally panned by just about every reviewer. If like me you've already got a mix of Alexa and Google Home devices, the Google Home kit doesn't support the Ring ecosystem well. In practical terms, the Google Assistant support to permit a Google Home Mini to chime on detection of motion just doesn't work. The home internet of things era will be hampered by this stupidity (on whoever's part). Come on guys/ gals - play nicely with Alexa/ Google Home/ Homekit integration and I'm sure your sales will increase.
Price - I purchased during an Amazon discount for the device (think mine was about £150). I just wish that Ring utilised PoE more fully, and maybe if they did so, their device costs could decrease as sales would increase. PoE is a far more stable technology. I'd be interested in a PoE Ring doorbell if only it didn't cost $350. I'd buy more if it cost less. WiFi is too fiddly and unreliable, especially on the outside of UK houses built from masonry.

I need to reduce the sensitivity on mine. There seem to be more magpies around at the moment, and the Ring's good at spotting these and alerting! Still impressive to be able to view your front garden remotely by phone.",0
"Ring Stick Up Cam Elite by Amazon, HD Security Camera with Two-Way Talk, Black, Works with Alexa",Electronics,nan,3.0,United Kingdom,2020-05-05,"Pros
- Well made
- Well packaged - comes with everything you need (apart from a drill ;-)
- Motion is sensitive and can be adjusted
- options of Ethernet or mains power via adapter

Cons
- In order to use this fully you will need to subscribe to ring £2.50 per month per device...forever!
There is no real need for this , Ring could either have had some memory on the cam or a memory slot for users to add their own cards.
There can be a lag of up to a couple of minutes before you can see the live video - even when I'm on the wifi in the house - pretty useless if someone is at the door (I have 150Mb fiber to the house with the latest BT Hub and 4 disc extenders, so its not my internet)
Resolution could be better - can't read a licence plate at 20 feet.",1
"Ring Stick Up Cam Elite by Amazon, HD Security Camera with Two-Way Talk, Black, Works with Alexa",Electronics,nan,4.0,United Kingdom,2019-12-20,"A nicely designed product that seems to work well.

I'm going to work out where to fit it outside (not sure if it will like facing South when the sun is low) , but on testing looking out through double glazing, it responds well, even to motion (not so well at night, but they do warn you about this).

I'm not sure how well it will survive our British winter weather and it is a pity it doesn't come with a much longer USB lead. Luckily you can buy 8 m ones that works well with it.

I'll add to this review once it is fitted outside.

Picture quality is good (but then it should be - its not cheap).",1
"Ring Stick Up Cam Elite by Amazon, HD Security Camera with Two-Way Talk, Black, Works with Alexa",Electronics,nan,1.0,United Kingdom,2020-01-16,"Quality of this camera is much better than the latest 3rd generation but some new features are unavailable for this camera for example, no privacy zones. The customised motion detection works pretty well and is the highlight for this edition. The only down point of this is if you do not subscribe to  the ring protect plan, this camera is literally useless  by that I mean you can only use it for live view. No recordings and the snapshot feature is disabled. Hence the one star otherwise it is a good camera. Ring should at least give 24hr recording as a basic standard. I have not tested the POE option as it seems like a lot of hassle with extra cabling and power leads.",1

Enough bits of kit for co-operative work, but not quite enough wires, etc., for them to make parallel circuits each. Very easy for them to make and remake circuits, though.

Snap Circuits Beginner Electronics Discovery Kit (Multi-Color),Electronics,25.99,5.0,United States,2020-01-30,"I got this for my nephew for Christmas and it was his favorite gift! He absolutely loved it and after we built a few circuits together, he did them all on his own (age 6 btw). The instructions are very clear and it's quite durable. The instructions direct one not to short the terminals on the battery pack as it will cause the on-board fuse to blow. My nephew did this a few times inadvertently but the fuse never blew, so that was reassuring. I suggest that the manufacturer install a breaker switch or a fuse that can be easily replaced if it does blow (the current fuse is a hard solder through-hole part that can't be easily accessed).

I didn't have any issues with the components not working out of the box. I checked every component with a DMM and they all checked out.

This kit doesn't go into any circuit theory (a little bit would be nice) but it is definitely an attention grabber and fun as heck for the kids. I will be buying the next model up for my nephew!",1
Snap Circuits Beginner Electronics Discovery Kit (Multi-Color),Electronics,25.99,5.0,United States,2020-05-03,"I had this kit sent directly to my son for his almost-7-year-old son. I also sent a larger kit for his 10-year-old son. They opened the kits soon after delivery.  My son just called to tell me that both kits are a huge hit. The boys immediately dived into the projects and have already done several. My son has enjoyed building a few projects, too! Thank you, Elenco, for making these educational yet entertaining kits available, especially when kids and their parents are staying home most of the time during the COVID-19 pandemic. I'm sure we'll be ordering more of them. (One downside: One of the two battery kits in the larger kit won't work. I've seen rave reviews about Elenco's excellent customer service, so we'll be requesting a replacement so the 10-year-old can build what he's most excited about -- an FM radio.)",2
Snap Circuits Beginner Electronics Discovery Kit (Multi-Color),Electronics,25.99,3.0,United States,2020-05-11,"My daughter Loved this!! She is 4.5 and I am using it to explain what electricity is, how is works, and what it is used for. Its a great and engageing way to explain electronics in a basic, hands on way.

A few things to mention here:

The instructions are exactly that... instructions. They show what to do, much like a Lego booklet. For $30, It would have been nice to have some kind of explanation of what exactly each lesson or project is expressing. Because I am able to explain it to her, its not that big of a deal to me, but explanations should be given since this is a teaching aid! Especially for users who are completely new and interested in electronics. Be informed... this is not an explanatory teaching aid, some knowledge or guidance is required for the user to know what the project is having them build.

The battery cover... irritating. There is no reason why the cover could not have been implemented in some form other than near micro screws. Overkill or lacking in design. For the price, a cheap micro screwdriver could have been thrown in.

On a positive note, I found this set to be engaging, and fun to use. My daughter especially like the lights on the motor, and was able to explain back to me how the circuit worked.",3
Snap Circuits Beginner Electronics Discovery Kit (Multi-Color),Electronics,25.99,5.0,United States,2020-01-08,"I was somewhat skeptical about buying this for a five year old but I figured I would give it a shot.  It turned out to be a great gift for my five year old grandson, and his sister at three was able to do some basic stuff with supervision (her choice - I did not push this on her).  After two sessions with me, they were able to go through the instructions by themselves.  While we worked on the kit together, I was able to talk some basics to the five year old (!!!) concerning circuits and switches (and one-way LEDS). Almost unbelievable, but the gospel truth.I highly recommend this kit!",1
Snap Circuits Beginner Electronics Discovery Kit (Multi-Color),Electronics,25.99,5.0,United States,2020-04-18,I got this for my 6 year old boy for Christmas at the recommendation of a friend.  This is a great toy that promotes hands on learning about science.  My son loves playing with it and tries to rework the pieces to make his own circuits.  The company also has great customer service.  The spinning fan stopped working after a few months and that was his favorite piece.  I went to the company's website and they will send you replacement pieces for free (took about a week or so).  I am planning on getting the larger versions of this as he gets older.,0
Snap Circuits Beginner Electronics Discovery Kit (Multi-Color),Electronics,25.99,3.0,United States,2019-12-26,"This is a fine STEM toy. It does have a flaw - the EGG. When you install the egg on the LED (which looked cool BTW), the egg acts like a huge lever on the two tiny wires that connects the diode. Whatever you do to the egg, say pushing it, pulling it, twisting it, etc., even with the lightest touch, will notably bend the wires. I tried to keep my 4 year old from touching the egg as much as I can but still, within one hour the LED is snapped off. This is clearly a design flaw - the base of the LED should have been sandwiched between two plastic pieces, rather than mounted on the top surface.",1

Snap Circuits Beginner Electronics Discovery Kit (Multi-Color),Electronics,25.99,5.0,United States,2020-03-02,"We bought this for my 6 year old for Christmas. He has loved playing with it and it's perfectly suited for his age. He can do all the projects outlined in the manual by himself. It's easy to use and holds his interest. We have had to replace two parts so far (two months in). One of the lamps (L4) and the battery pack (B3B) have broken already. The plastic piece holding the battery anodes broke in two places from the pressure of the batteries against the spring. So far, Elenco has had great customer service and has replaced both pieces free of charge. But they will only replace three pieces per customer for free, and give the rate of breakage, I'm a little concerned I'll exceed that limit. My son loves this toy, and it's really one of the best Stem toys for his age group I've seen, so I still recommend it, but it would be nice if the pieces were a little higher quality.",0
Snap Circuits Beginner Electronics Discovery Kit (Multi-Color),Electronics,25.99,5.0,United States,2020-01-08,"I was skeptical that my 5 year old Nephew could use this kit by himself.  Was I wrong.  The way that the teaching book diagrams each project allows the child to visually see how each piece is installed.  The ease of installation of each piece gave him the confidence to experiment in each project.  After working with my Nephew on a couple of projects, he was ready to tackle the rest of the projects himself.  The pride and sense of accomplishment he experienced was priceless.

"Preciva Soldering Iron Station, 60W Professional Digital Soldering Station, 90-480℃ Temperature Adjustable Repair Tool Kit with Soldering Tips, Solder Wire and Frame, Sponge, Suction Device, etc.",Electronics,40.99,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-05-02,"I bought this product as I wanted to upgrade from a naff soldering iron I had bought for £5 (on that directly plugs into mains, has a basic metal for for a stand, and is a recipe for burning your house down). As a hobbyist, I didn't want to spend top dollar for an expensive soldering iron station. This seemed to do the job well, had temperature control, and a decent stand to hold the soldering iron.

Pros:
- Comes with tip cleaner (small pot of brass tip cleaner), a small sponge to wipe excessive solder, 5 additional tips, a solder sucker, temperature control (+ switch to choose degrees C/F), and easy on/off switch.
- The product is very easy to setup.
- There is a roll of solder. The label reads: lead free solder wire (Sn 99.3%, Cu 0.7%), Diameter 0.8mm, Melting point: 227 C.
- The cable from the stand to the soldering iron is strong enough to not easily break, but flexible enough to actually use without dragging the base with it or coiling back up.

Cons:
- The last 1-2mm of the fine ironing tip doesn't seem to heat up to the temperature reading, but after those initial few mm, the solder melts fine.
- The base is rather light. I was expecting it to be a bit more weighty to lower the center of mass of the product and prevent a hot iron from falling over (fortunately this hasn't happened).
- There is a solder roll holder, which is a bit flimsy. This doesn't bother me personally as I don't use it, but it is worth mentioning.

I am really pleased so far with this product. It is definitely worth the upgrade from a basic disastrous soldering iron (my previous iron described above). I have not run into any major issues, and I would recommend this to others.",9

To buy a brand name would be 4x the cost. However to most hobbyists this would make a great soldering station option. Ive never owned a digitally controlled iron before and the ceramic core with hollow tips allow it to heat up Incredibly quickly. There are 5 alternative tips provided (1 of those is identical to the one fitted and probably the most commonly used) and station makes a good attempt at providing everything you need to solder, only lacking flux and desolder braid. The stand for the solder reel is a quaint touch but may not suit everyone's soldering technique. However its screw attachment means its optional so up to you if you want to fit it or use it separately from the station.  Overall for the money,  I'd highly recommend this station.",9

"Preciva Soldering Iron Station, 60W Professional Digital Soldering Station, 90-480℃ Temperature Adjustable Repair Tool Kit with Soldering Tips, Solder Wire and Frame, Sponge, Suction Device, etc.",Electronics,40.99,4.0,United Kingdom,2020-01-16,"This arrived yesterday and I've had it out of the box to test/use it already.The box it comes in is small and tidy with all the things packed inside.The iron itself is on a nice flexible lead, not one of those mamba types that fight you every inch of the way while trying to use it.  The base unit is however on a mamba lead and not very flexible at all.In use the iron heats up very quickly and holds temperatures very well.  The dial used to set the temperature is a little fiddly to be honest but I don't need a precise temp for what I'm using, within a degree C will do and this thing is easy to set like that.I was impressed with the bit that the iron has installed out of the box.  It worked!  Normally I need to overheat them a little and dip them in solder to get them to coat (properly called 'tinning the bit').  This one was a breeze to get going, no problems at all.So why only 4 stars?  Well, the iron is fine, better than fine so far, very good in fact.  It's the other things that come with it that are letting it down.There is a solder sucker that doesn't.  It sucks at sucking.  Worse than useless.  I have a very old one I've had for 25 years that is a lot better.The lead-free solder is cheap and not worth using.  Personally I don't like lead-free solder and don't use it, it 'furs' after a few years and has to be replaced.  This is a common failure in modern equipment these days, the lead-free solder they use just doesn't last.The solder holder is quite useless as it keeps the roll by the stand/main unit if screwed in (for stability) rather than where you're actually doing the soldering, which thanks to that nice flexible lead can be several feet away..  If not screwed in then its too light to really do the job of holding your solder reel properly.  I've given up on it and use it just to keep my solder handy for use by having it with the main unit and I remove it when I need it.",14

Heats up super fast (shows the temp as its warms up)
Decent quality
Good length cables (1m plug to station, 0.5m station to iron)

Cons
Temp dial can be hard sometimes to get right where you want it.

They're cheap, you switch them on, and use them.... that said, I've just thrown the last one away because it didn't seem to melt the solder despite getting hot. I selected this because it seemed a reasonable price and I liked the sound of the actual temperature being visible.
I have used the device once, and I can say it definitely seems to work as I expected - you can watch the temperature as it gets up to heat or cools. Incidentally, it heats up incredibly quickly - way quicker than I expected given my previous experience with standard soldering irons.

I felt the instructions let the device down a bit in so much as I think the two machine screws that come with it are so you can attach the solder roll holder to the side if you want to, but I couldn't see how to do this. Everything else was self explanatory though and I ultimately decided it was best not to attach the dispenser as it means I can use the box it came in as a storage box. It packs away really neatly..

The solder sucker seemed cheaply built (very light compared to one I bought in the past), but it worked really well so I can't fault its operation and it was a welcome addition to the kit.

I can't compare this to others that are similar in price, or much more expensive because I've not bought one before, but, I'd definitely buy this again from my experience so far as it seems to meet all my needs. I'm not really clear what much more expensive options could add extra, but I'm only a hobby level user.",4

However, it’s a terrible product. It doesn’t keep the temperature when coming into contact with component wires and as a result it barely solders joints even on the highest setting. If you are lucky enough to get the soles to take you’re left with dry joints as it’s taken so long and the flux has gone. Waste of money. Should have got a Weller instead.",6

This unit was very well priced and seemed to include everything I would ever need: temperature control, tip cleaner, solder spool holder and a range of tips for different tasks.
On delivery, I was pleasantly surprised by the weight of the unit and the bonus inclusion of a solder pump. Overall build quality was spoiled by the grommet on the wire to the iron being loose but I'll forgive this oversight.
The iron reaches the selected temperature reasonably quickly.

After a lot of blown components and poor solder finish I decided to look for something else.I wasn't sure about this one given that similar solder stations cost a lot more. But given the reviews I decided to try it. Well, I've been using it a lot lately and actually it has improved my soldering. I like the temperature display and it heats up so fast it's ready in less than a minute. My last one took at least 5 minutes.

It comes with five nice tips, and a solder sucker, which I didn’t realise when I ordered it.  The little roller attachment for solder seems a bit wimpy, but I haven’t had it pop loose yet, so I suppose it works well enough.  It heats up quickly, and I appreciate the readout to show you the temp it thinks the iron is at as it is heating.  Also, if you wish, it allows you to select Celsius or Fahrenheit for the temperature display.The main issue that I really don’t think the temperature reading is accurate.  I think it shows a higher temp than the iron is actually generating.  For my type of work, this is not critical, as I can just adjust the temp upwards until I can do the work I want, but it you really need accurate temperature control for some reason, you might want to look to go to a higher-end model.  For a hobbyist like me, though, this is fine and a good value.",0

The unit arrived promptly with the station, a solder sucker, 5 replacement tips, a roll of solder and a small carriage to hold the solder reel in use.

Thankfully, the cabling on both the mains wiring and to the soldering iron itself are ""soft"" - my Antex has really hard cabling, and it's hard to solder with that.

I don't like conical bits for soldering, so I changed to the spade tip supplied, and following the instructions, heated up to 300 degrees C - that didn't take very long, most impressive - and tinned the bit. I then turned down to 250 degrees C before soldering. Seems to be a very good system.

I would happily recommend this as a hobby soldering station. I'm no professional, I play around with electronics for fun, but this little station looks like it will be well used!

Yihua have been making soldering products in China for 10 +Years and have a good pedigree, so I thought I would give them a try. I’m glad I did as it is an ergonomically well-designed unit, well controlled and operates perfectly.
Better than the now defunct Wep 937D it replaces.
It may seem a little expensive, but in comparison to the more expensive contemporaries, I consider this unit to be a good all round package that is extremely good value!

People have been using it for various purposes and hobbies and i thought i would like to put in my review too, especially for people who also like mech keeb like i do.The soldering iron is what i really like in this kit. It heats up very nicely and retain the temperature well. I produced the cleanest desoldering work with this iron and i love it so far.

"ASPECTEK Professional Electronic Indoor Insect killer,Bug Zapper,Fly Zapper,Mosquito Killer,30W UV Bulbs for Home & Commercial Use (UK PLUG)",Electronics,52.49,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-05-20,"This is a great piece of kit for getting rid of flies, mosquitoes etc. It started working  immediately after being plugged in. I have it positioned just inside the front terrace of my villa in Spain (which is the main entrance to the house). This takes care of the vast majority of insects that manage to sneak in when the outside doors are open, before they get to the fly screen door.There is a bit of a crack when the insects come into contact with the elements, which can make you jump on occassion, but that's just the way it is. It is a pretty efficient machine. The only complaint I have is that the cable is way too short, being only 2 metres long. This means using an extension lead if you want to position the unit high up. An easy thing to address, I would have thought.",2

We never really knew if our old one was working, even though the blue lights were on, but we definitely know that this one is working.  In spite of the fact that we have netting at the door and roof vents, flies, aphids and other small buzzing and biting critters get in but this Zapper kills them all with a loud “crack!” that at first makes you nearly jump out of your skin.  You can hear it going off like a pistol shot from the other end of the garden and know with some satisfaction that “another one bites the dust”.  It means that tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers and lettuce grown in the greenhouse are strong and healthy, no greenfly or whitefly as far as I can see, and no insect killer used on plants.  Don’t know what this would be like in a house though.  I have thought about getting another one for the kitchen, but it is quite bulky, though very effective.

Never thought I'd be in two minds about killing flies but the reality is pretty gruesome. It is effective and most flies seem compelled to meet their deaths when it is switched on. But it is very difficult to position because the electric cord is stupidly short and doesn't easily reach any of our plugs. A real design fail and if had known I would have kept looking for another design. It's also much bigger than I expected - should have looked at the description more carefully.

The only issue is that they don't seem to be very attracted to it.  Even when it's otherwise dark and the zapper is the only thing emitting any light they still do not seem to be drawn to it which is what the light is supposed to do I believe.  I had 4 or 5 flies merrily buzzing around the kitchen and they weren't the least bit interested in the blue lights, it was only by accident they got zapped.  So for £50 I'm not that impressed.

The only criticisms I have are: firstly, it doesn't always kill flies instantly, a lot of them struggle on for some time before dying, so maybe a higher wattage fly killer might be more humane; secondly very few of the smaller flies (eg fruit flies) drop into the tray, they are mostly thrown away from the appliance so you have to keep it well away from food but I would imagine this applies to any similar electronic fly killer; the heavier house flies do drop into the tray.

Well luckily it works and it works really well! The cord isn't very long though so an exntension cord may be needed, but this does indeed attract flies. Mostly tiny flies rather than large 'blue bottle' flies, they mostly get attracted overnight or dawn/dusk when it's the only lightsource. It catches maybe 1 - 3 in the span of 24 hours depending on if you have doors or windows open everyday or how many flies are in your environment.

TC Electronic Forcefield Compressor,Electronics,nan,3.0,United States,2020-01-04,"Before you add this to your cart, ask yourself these questions; do I want a comp pedal to use an effect or to use as a signal compression device? There’s a difference, using as an effect you hear a massive difference when you kick it on. As an effect you probably want “squash, punch, and a bit of extra gain. This pedal does NOT do this.This pedal is for audio compression on a wave form basis. It offers a ton of compression but with subtle attack and zero gain. I use this for clean jazz guitar and bass where I want attack volume to be calmed down without you knowing it. It does the job, for the money it’s worth it, you won’t find this in an effect pedal. Moving up to the full size might even be nicer having the blend control.My only complaint would be that I could never get the tone print to work and there is a bit of line distortion but not enough to get upset about, what would you expect for $80?",3

Monopoly Voice Banking Electronic Family Board Game for Ages 8 and up,Electronics,nan,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-02-16,"I've moved on from Monopoly in my love for board games, however I like to keep my hand in. I was a bit disappointed with the Electronic Banker edition, which tried to streamline the game but the technology, in hindsight, wasn't as good as it needed to be. This one however - I'm impressed.

This iteration does not remove the runaway leader aspect that is evident in most of the versions. Perhaps that slow erosion of other players wealth is your draw to the series. I find that slog rather depressing, so at least it's quicker in this version. My taste though, is not under review.

Less properties per side, with only the need for a single house (or in fact, an option to go straight to a hotel) really speeds this up. It feels like Monopoly Lite. It makes for potential 30m games with two players, just over an hour with four (keeping it snappy). Less lucky games can still be a couple of hours at a maximum (but not that four hour affair of the original). The maximum player count is four with updated player tokens (including a dinosaur!).

The only cards are the deeds (minimal content upon them, with the reduction in housing above) and a single GOOJF card (you'll work that out). This keeps clutter to a minimum and the absence of money is handled really well. The digital assistant is top notch for two reasons. Speech recognition is very good - it does make the odd error, easily undone with the cancel button (and can be repeated with the other button). More importantly, it's concise. A little theatre is added with sound effects, however there are no long monologues - it's quick and to the point, facilitating swift gameplay. The speech is clear and doesn't sound cheap. This was exceptionally refreshing and a genuine surprise.

Each player gets a player aid, explaining how to verbally activate each choice (purchase a property, pass go, demand rent etc.). After a short time it's easy to carry out your instructions without needing to reference the card. All book-keeping is automatic, clearly explained by the digital assistant. You can also ask about your balance and who's winning too. The whole digital integration in to the classic game has been well thought out to make it as simple as possible. Since each player has their own button to use (player piece dependant) keeping track is easy and if you make an mistakes the game usually points it out.

There are other changes to the rules in there to spice things up too. Trading player cards without consent mixes things up in a ""take-that!"" way, auctions are simple and how running out of money is tracked, enforcing sales, keeps things flowing quickly too.

Overall, this simpler and accessible version is a real winner for me and I'd no longer fear the family or friends suggesting a game.",1
Monopoly Voice Banking Electronic Family Board Game for Ages 8 and up,Electronics,nan,2.0,United Kingdom,2019-12-21,"Very disappointing. I do not like this at all, and it is not very user friendly, it feels as if it is made on the cheap just to trade on the Monopoly name. There is a maximum of four players, which is too limiting. The playing pieces (tokens) are all made of a green plastic - almost indistinguishable from each other unless you are really close, which is confusing. The houses and hotels are an even flimsier plastic and move out of place at the slightest draught. The box states that there are 8 houses and 12 hotels. This set has 7 houses and 13 hotels, hardly effective quality control!  The rules are a bit different and the game is soon over, which is a relief as the poor quality meant that there is far more frustration than pleasure. The top hat idea wouldn’t have been better if it recognised different voices more easily, for us it didn’t and it made the game so irritating. It is now back in its box, we have returned to using our old, original Monopoly, which is shabby now but gives lots of fun, includes all of us and does not force us to have auctions/trades.",2

Monopoly Voice Banking Electronic Family Board Game for Ages 8 and up,Electronics,nan,5.0,United Kingdom,2019-12-30,"We have played this all over Christmas as a family and we're still not bored. One of the things about monopoly is that the money is a pain and the cards hanging about the board are also a pain. This version of the game takes all of the hassle out of the game and allows you enjoy just playing!

In the middle of the board is a simplified Alexa-type module that responds to voices and prompts. You move around the board as is traditional with dice and a character, but according to what you land on, you press the appropriate character button and for e.g. buy property or chance card, or pay rent. The module keeps a tally of all your money, property, houses etc. Cheating is not possible and we found the game so much more fun.

The board itself is more simplified than it used to be (but it's not just this version, monopoly seems to have done this to all new editions) in that each suit of properties is only two not three and community chest has gone, just leaving chance cards.

I can't recommend this version of the game highly enough and the price is very fair.",0
Monopoly Voice Banking Electronic Family Board Game for Ages 8 and up,Electronics,nan,1.0,United Kingdom,2020-01-18,"I absolutely love Monopoly, as do all my family. I also love tech and innovative new improvements to everyday stuff. This looked like the perfect combination - so I ordered ready for the Christmas/New Years holidays.

Upon opening the product everything was looking good! It’s probably the most aesthetic Monopoly board of all time, it really does look great. The character pieces look good quality and the main command unit looks really cool.

HOWEVER...

The command unit was unbelievably frustrating! Mr Monopoly got almost EVERY command wrong!

To make things worse, you then have to physically press the “X” button to rectify any mistake made, before continuing with the game.

We followed the instructions to the letter, but nothing seemed to work.

It completely ruined the Monopoly experience and we all gave up within 5 minutes of starting. It’s unplayable!

Ruined my plans of playing Monopoly with the family over the holidays. I really wish I just ordered a classic version.

Overall, this is an absolutely terrible product. It looks good but who cares when it’s unbelievably frustrating and barely works. Get the classic version instead. Hasbro, what are you doing to Monopoly?!",1
Monopoly Voice Banking Electronic Family Board Game for Ages 8 and up,Electronics,nan,1.0,United Kingdom,2020-01-10,"We are so disappointed with how awful this is. Let me preface the following by saying that we are massive Monopoly fans in this house. We already own 5+ different versions of this game and play it regularly so we were super excited to get this new version. Unfortunately it was a total let down and I definitely wouldn't recommend it as a version of the game.

We've played a few times now. The starting money amount is not enough to do very much, you need to have rules for 2 players (such as no auctions). The whole ""trade"" square is silly (especially with two players). The two of each colour set is not enough. The lack of transport squares is disappointing. Everything about this version takes away from any skill you need to play monopoly, and makes it all about luck of the dice. (I hate games purely based on luck).
The voice needs a volume control, and we have had a few moments where a cough has been taken as a command or we wanted to undo something and you don't know if you have or not. The pieces are not the best either. They are all sort of see through green and look quite similar to each other. And the property values are awful. Not much difference in each set of colours. Not much better to have whole set on one side to the opposite. Major fail on the money side of it! Having now read the reviews about it not understanding people, we didn't have that as such. It just picked up every tiny noise we made and took it as a random command.

If I had to look for the positives, there are a couple. We thought the hat was ok - it understood us. It could potentially be useful for taking away on holiday as a condensed version of the game since it's smaller than the original and most variations. If you happen to prefer games of luck to games of strategy, you may prefer this version.

But for me personally, I wouldn't recommend this one over older versions at all.",0
Monopoly Voice Banking Electronic Family Board Game for Ages 8 and up,Electronics,nan,5.0,United Kingdom,2019-12-27,"This isn't Monopoly as you know it!  I have compared this game to the full version as something akin to the difference between 20/20 cricket and a full test match.  Basically this is a much more interactive game and, unlike the original, the first player who succeeds in getting one set does not nearly always win.Out of the box you receive a board, the voice banking module, a set of property cards, 4 player pieces (not 6) and hotels and houses.  4 players is not the only change.  This game has been designed to be much quicker and at first, we thought that it would not be as entertaining.  How wrong can you be.  So what is different?+. Only two properties per set for a start, unlike the traditional games where it is only the Mayfair/Old Kent combination which is two properties and the rest three.+. You only have to buy a house before you purchase a hotel, not 4.+. Community chest has been consigned to the bin, you only have chance now -similar with utilities.  The stations remain, but now, via the voice controller, when you land on a ""station"" you simply get told to move to a different location+. in place of the utilities, you now get exchange care.  Land on this square, pay $100 dollars and you can exchange one of your property cards for someone else's; even if they don't want to.  Straight swap if you wish, Old Kent for Mayfair!!  This livens up the game and removes the option for the gloating relative, who hoards all the properties and both spoils and prolongs the game to be forced to release properties.Game play is much simpler and thankfully over quicker now.So what about the voice banking.  Well you have to play it in a quiet environment in order for the voice recognition to work properly.  We found that the module recognised our commands over 90% of the time and if not, we pressed the reset button and gave the command again.  It really is very good and kept a tally of our financial state, our bank balances etc - even declaring the winner when someone iOS made bankrupt.It is questionable as to whether this is a better game than the original board game, personally, as the difficult relative who generally hoards the properties and makes everyone's life hell, I am not sure, for everyone else, it is far better and particularly younger children, who having failed to secure a property empire in 20 minutes or less go off and sulk.  Now they are engaged much more and even when losing, enjoy the game much more.Not necessarily better then than the original, but our family really enjoys playing it.",0
Monopoly Voice Banking Electronic Family Board Game for Ages 8 and up,Electronics,nan,4.0,United Kingdom,2019-12-28,"My husband and I are big fans of the original Monopoly game and have played it many times. This new version is good and does not take as much space as the original as this one uses an electronic top hat interactive banking machine.

The board has 1 less property per coloured property section, e.g pink properties on the original only have 2 properties on this one. There is no paper money as the machine is used instead.

When we play Monopoly we tend not to have any background noise so for two adults this game was good, but we did have the occasional problem when using the machine. My husband has a strong local accent so he had to make more of an effort to speak clearly. I tend to speak quickly and again this caused the machine problems.

The game does not take as long to play as the original one, that can take several hours.

Overall this was a good game, that does have a few problems with the interactive machine, but its okay if we speak clearly and slowly. The playing pieces do not feel as good a quality as the original ones and there are less individual playing pieces. I think my husband and I both agree that we do prefer the original but that is because we have played that version so many times. I do think that it would be good for those new to the game though.",0
Monopoly Voice Banking Electronic Family Board Game for Ages 8 and up,Electronics,nan,2.0,United Kingdom,2019-12-20,"Gave up on this because halfway through each game the banker decides a property is held by the wrong person and can't be fixed, so game over.That aside it's been watered down to a classy version of snakes and ladders. There's no taxes, no train stations (it's now a annoying trip to a random place on the board, only two of each set, you can buy a hotel for one property and have the other vacant and for some reason the rent is the same as the purchase price?!  I like the idea of the computer figuring the finances out but it just gives you the sense that everything is free and you have no idea who's rich or about to go bankrupt. The bank suprisingly good at voice commands but just not good enough for a board game. If you want to hear someone going ""buy...buy...buy..."" for 5 minutes because the hat doesn't understand their voice this is the game for you.Ignoring the fact the pieces are cheap green transparent plastic so you can't make out which piece is yours this is suitable for 8 year olds and no one else - it might even bore kids after 2 games. It plays like an interactive story, not a game... more strategy in a game of snap",1
Monopoly Voice Banking Electronic Family Board Game for Ages 8 and up,Electronics,nan,4.0,United Kingdom,2019-12-29,"Monopoly is one of those traditional games that seems to have been around for ever, well at least in my life.  The makers are always looking for ways to freshen it up and in the past we have purchased other variations including themed and credit cards etc but this one is by far the most pleasing. I have read reviews saying that others had difficulties but my experiences were only good. The game reacted well to my Brummie accent and the device made one of the tedious parts of the game a lot more fun. A classic game with a few tweaks but overall a success.",0
Monopoly Voice Banking Electronic Family Board Game for Ages 8 and up,Electronics,nan,4.0,United Kingdom,2020-01-06,"Monopoly is a great game, if not the best and most popular board game ever.
BUT it has always been a slow game especially if you had the full 8 players.

The biggest problem has always been the banker who has to work out just who owns what and deal with a fat wad of notes..

The game intodays X Boxes and the like was too slow and a little too complex for players.
Hasbro have succeeded in speeding the game up by restricting the number of players to just four and in replacing the banker with a Voice Banking Electronic system.

Now I found that the game speeded up and the game was much easier to play.
True you do have to take the time to pronounce the words and places correctly for the voice recognition system to understand.

The result is a new take on a well-loved, Family Board Game for Ages 8 and up.

Make sure you have a full set of charged batteries installed.",0
Monopoly Voice Banking Electronic Family Board Game for Ages 8 and up,Electronics,nan,4.0,United Kingdom,2019-12-30,"Negatives:
- Box flimsy- No way of organising cards in box, no elastic or section- Player pieces all same colour - very confusing for players to find their piece- Player pieces fall over, hard to tell what way they are meant to go up- Voice recognition unit only really understands RP/Queen's English. Us Irish had to put on an upper class English accent to be understood. - Voice unit makes frequent mistakes and misunderstands directions
Positives:
- Game is fun- Games are shorter than the classic Monopoly game which drags on for hours- Game is simplified version of the full game
The game is fun, but as an adult, I could see myself getting bored pretty quickly, but the kids enjoyed it.
The game needs to be explained fully to kids and an adult present during play to make sure things go well. Recommended as it is.",0
Monopoly Voice Banking Electronic Family Board Game for Ages 8 and up,Electronics,nan,3.0,United Kingdom,2019-12-27,"My initial thoughts are that if it isn't broken, don't fix it... unfortunately, the creators have obviously tried to give the game a tech upgrade in an age where everything seems to have to revolve around tech. The voice activated banker, is very much like an amazon echo device and is there to deliver game instructions, like tell you what you get on chance and keeping tally of your money. However, there can be some delays and also, you can only have 2-4 players.We much prefer the original monopoly and I don't think we will be playing this version very often at all. It really didn't need the added tech. Even though it did peak my curiosity, we can't say we are that impressed.",0

The micro shredding is brilliant. Compared to my previous cross-cut shredder there is absolutely no chance of reconstructing the documents and also the waste bin is not rapidly filled with strips of paper and an astonishing amount of wasted air-space. The micro shreds fill the bin far less quickly and are easily tipped out and disposed of. A neat perspex window in the front of the bin shows you how full it is. The shredder also munches up credit cards quite nicely into shreds that can't be identified or reconstructed. Oddly though it won't deal with CD's or DVD's.My use is for low volume home/office and whilst the blurb says it will cope with 8 sheets of 70 gsm paper at a time, I find that it 6 sheets of 80 gsm paper are as much as it wants to cope with. Card and thicker paper need to go through as single sheets. It is noisy to operate but all shredders are. For occasional domestic and light office use it should be fine. It will definitely struggle with bulk shredding operations and the manual says it will cut out after 5 minutes of continuous shredding after which it will time-out for 30 minutes to protect the motor.I have ordered some Fellowes shredder oil to keep it in peak condition and if it continues to perform well I shall be very pleased.",6

When you are eventually able to find, download & unzip so you can read the tutorial/directions (not possible on a tablet) you discover it does not start at beginner level. Instead initially concentrates on programming.
page 10:
""Lesson 0 What is Arduino
What is Arduino
Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software.""
& you are thinking: when you do get to actually connecting any of the components supplied? Then further down the page you find this gem:
""Elegoo UNO
In this tutorial, we will use the Elegoo UNO control board to build the example circuits as a reference, and these Lessons will show you how to use these electronic components correctly.
*This Kit dose not include the Elegoo UNO control board""

So what is the Control board supplied & what use is it? Or is there ANY control board in the package.
This was sent direct as a gift - you fairly believe that the image shows the contents included.
Its not until you get to page 43 that you get any information that's going to tell about the Fun? kit contents in any helpful way.
But the illustrated connections indicated are not even possible because the controller is so different and not explained.
This is supposed to be suitable for a beginner but it is far from that.
It could have been helpful if the control board referred to & pictured with illustrated example had been the one in the Fun kit but it isn't.
Worse you don't even get to anything like beginner until page 43 of 223 up until then it wants you to connect to a computer & download programming information & links.
Something few cautious begginers would want to risk. Especially if they have become dubious about the company from the unhelpful tutorial and suspect damage might be possible.
If you just want to learn about electronic components & how they work to be able to do some really simple things and to understand the uses as well as dangers which is really important this will not help.
So seriously regret getting this which was supposed to offer helpful beginner tutorial as a gift for a youngster.
It is not helpful. having looked at some of the other negative feedback which confirms our experience, now we think it is potentially actually dangerous.
such a disappointment.",2

Having bought it to get someone started I'm disappointed in nearly every item.

The solid core jumper wires are randomly coloured and miss some useful lengths for breadboarding (e.g. bus to first hole blacks and reds) as well as flimsy.
The jumper cables are terrible, the crimps are all cold and poorly pressed, many pins will come out of the cable and remain in the board on first insertion, and very few will survive more than a few dozens.
The ""power module"" switch is now clicking empty all the time after less than a hundred activations and needs wiggling to get a 1 in 10 hit. And beginners will still need to power it with at least 7 volts, meaning buying a separate variable or 9v adapter.
The tact switches have some of the worst bounce I've seen on these models, and a couple failed very quickly.

The transistors are just a bunch of NPNs, which sure are more common in projects, but for a beginner a few more and a small handful of matching PNPs would have been useful to play with someone's first op-amps.
No MOSFETs, at least a couple belong in any beginner kit.

It gets two stars and not one because the assortment of RC components and LEDs is OK and they are all surprisingly close to spec, though that's more of a testament to the quality of cheap components in general than this specific vendor.
The breadboard is also OK, though you can find better for less (silver plated channels and less parasitic capacitance.)

For 20 quids one could pick up a much better set of parts from small local vendors and realize more interesting projects than this gives access to. Don't waste your money on this if you're a beginner or wanting to make a gift to one.",4

Delivered on time and re-packaging was secure. (Ordered from Amazon Warehouse)
Actual product I'm disappointed with.
Breadboard, hit and miss when making connections. Until I realised this I blamed and double checked everything else. Connecting wires poor quality, crimped ends fall off to easy. Listed projects within the kit to complete do not have the basic/cheap wiring connectors to do so. I found I had to order them as extras, though they are better quality. Why not charge just a 'little' bit more for the kit and include them, it states it is a beginners kit?

In summary. As long as you are aware of the quality/reliability of some items it's ok.",0

I think it's good value for money, and you can do quite a lot with the kit, but it has a few quirks:
The LEDs weren't in a recloseable bag.
It's hard to insert things into the main part of the breadboard. I often have to use tweezers. (Miniature pliers would be better.) Strangely, the power rails don't require as much force.
The kit comes with 5 NPN transistors but adding 1 or 2 PNP transistors would be nice.
Weird selection of resistor values: 10 each of 10R, 100R, 330R, 1k0, 2k0, 5k1, 10k, 100k, 1M and 30 220R. Maybe they chose those values because they had particular circuits in mind.
It would be nice if the jumper wires used the component colour code to indicate length (like another jumper kit I have does), i.e., red=0.2"", orange=0.3"", etc..",0

- Enough components to get you started.
- Everything comes nicely packaged.
- Customer service is great - I had a problem with the breadboard and emailed the seller. Without any questions they simply sent me a whole new package (with everything) completely FREE, which arrived a couple days laters.

Cons:
- breadboard is FAR too small for comfort but does do the job.
- no power supply is in the box, but a simple usb from your laptop or any usb charger will work just fine.

Overall:
- if you’ve never tried playing around with electronics you cannot beat the value this offers as a starter kit - especial you decide it isn’t for you.
- if you already know you like building circuits I would go for something more substantial in terms of component variety and the quality and size of the breadboard.

But overall am very happy with the purchase and the seller service.",0

Snap Circuits PLUS Electronics Exploration Kits | Full Color Project Manual | STEM Educational Toy for Kids 8+ (SC-310),Electronics,nan,3.0,United Kingdom,2019-12-30,My son loves this.  We’ve tried a few circuits and he loves seeing the results and understanding how things work.So why only 3 stars??  A couple of the components are faulty (one being a switch that works intermittently).  I haven’t contacted the seller yet but hopefully they’ll replace the faulty parts and I’ll adjust the rating accordingly.  This was purchased at a reduced price during Cyber Monday deals so I don’t particularly want a refund as I’d have to pay much more to replace it so I’m hoping the seller will resolve the issue directly.,11
Snap Circuits PLUS Electronics Exploration Kits | Full Color Project Manual | STEM Educational Toy for Kids 8+ (SC-310),Electronics,nan,4.0,United Kingdom,2019-12-21,"I had something a bit like this when I was a kid - that was over 50 years ago! The kt I had was made by Philips and was much more fiddly to use as the components were connected into the circuits using tiny spring clips and you needed to use wire strippers. This is much easier to use as the components are mounted on plugs which locate into a board. Bought this for one of my nephews for Christmas.

Stylophone The Original Pocket Electronic Organ,Electronics,24.99,1.0,United Kingdom,2020-01-02,"A present for my young nephew - if I could award minus 5 stars I would. This is an extremely poor imitation of the original - whilst pricey for what it is, it’s ultimately cheap and nasty.

Complete rip off.",18

Great for annoying co-workers with my renditions of 80s classics in the office (back when working in offices was still a thing) Now I do the same but using Microsoft Teams (other remote working solutions are available)

Hot Wires Electronics Kit from John Adams,Electronics,35.99,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-01-04,"My grandson (aged 7) is not very academic, but thoroughly enjoys the little electronic projects they make at school. He was absolutely delighted with this kit, which contains the bits and pieces to make lots of little electronic gizmos. Stupid Grandma let the side down however by failing to provide any batteries! We robbed something else of its batteries so he could get one of the projects going.As an aside, I opted to have this delivered 'without Amazon packaging'. I understand that this means the contents will be visible, but to my horror, the box arrived with no packaging at all and the address label stuck straight on the box. It took me at least half an hour to carefully, carefully, peel this off and then another half hour gently rubbing the sticky residue off with nail varnish remover to make it look like a present again. The box also arrived quite battered, which I couldn't do anything about. Lesson learned there!",1
Hot Wires Electronics Kit from John Adams,Electronics,35.99,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-03-12,"My son (8) needed help with getting started but now makes circuits and thinks he is a genius. He loves the fan which flies in the air, but only if you connect one way - it reverses the other way and can’t get up speed or direction to lift. He wasn’t interested in using it to start - had at Christmas, but as soon as I sat with him and opened to box he was delighted. Sturdy pieces which use press stud clips. Clear slots to keep pieces in place after use. Includes bulbs, switches etc but you need AA batteries - 6 of them - 3 in each battery pack.",12

Hot Wires Electronics Kit from John Adams,Electronics,35.99,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-01-20,"My son won this as a competition prize.  He's recently turned 7 and I wasn't sure if he would manage given it says 8+, but it's a brilliant combination of being simple to put together, but having enough about it for it to be suitable for much older in terms of the learning involved.  He can follow the instructions himself, but the concepts will keep him learning more for several years.  His current favourite is the spinning disc (although he did lose it behind a bookcase yesterday).  We were at a relatives on Saturday and he literally spent all day on it, several hours on it on Sunday, did another two experiments before school today (and was excited to show me his dark activated light).  My 70+ year old Dad loved doing some of it with him - especially the sound activated light.  I thought I might be worried about him breaking it but it's really solid construction.",0

Snap Circuits PLUS Electronics Exploration Kits | Full Color Project Manual | STEM Educational Toy for Kids 8+ (SC-110),Electronics,nan,4.0,United Kingdom,2020-03-10,Another thing that is better now than it was when I was a kid.  This is an outstanding idea that makes building the circuits a breeze so you can focus on the learning.One point lost because 1) too much emphasis on noise-producing circuits and 2) the whistle chip is not sensitive enough for work properly in some examples.,3

Snap Circuits PLUS Electronics Exploration Kits | Full Color Project Manual | STEM Educational Toy for Kids 8+ (SC-110),Electronics,nan,3.0,United Kingdom,2019-12-30,My son loves this.  We’ve tried a few circuits and he loves seeing the results and understanding how things work.So why only 3 stars??  A couple of the components are faulty (one being a switch that works intermittently).  I haven’t contacted the seller yet but hopefully they’ll replace the faulty parts and I’ll adjust the rating accordingly.  This was purchased at a reduced price during Cyber Monday deals so I don’t particularly want a refund as I’d have to pay much more to replace it so I’m hoping the seller will resolve the issue directly.,11
Snap Circuits PLUS Electronics Exploration Kits | Full Color Project Manual | STEM Educational Toy for Kids 8+ (SC-110),Electronics,nan,4.0,United Kingdom,2019-12-21,"I had something a bit like this when I was a kid - that was over 50 years ago! The kt I had was made by Philips and was much more fiddly to use as the components were connected into the circuits using tiny spring clips and you needed to use wire strippers. This is much easier to use as the components are mounted on plugs which locate into a board. Bought this for one of my nephews for Christmas. He hasn't actually received it yet, but I'm anticipating most of the family will enjoy building electronic gadgets with it.",3

"Alesis CompactKit 4 – Tabletop Electric Drum Set with 70 Electronic / Acoustic Drum Kit Sounds, 4 Pads, Battery or AC-Power and Drum Sticks Included",Electronics,nan,3.0,United Kingdom,2020-07-17,"To be fair, you should be class this as a toy. I bought it for my 6 year old son, but being quite musical myself, I thought I'd get some enjoyment out of it, and I have. However, few things to note. One, sound quality of the different samples (the various drum noises) is varied by quality and volume. The speakers are poor and don't really do the unit justice. The ""coaching"" mode uses its built-in LCD screen, with one of four bars falling from the top to the bottom to indicate when to hit it (a bar each for each of the drum pads). These are designed to teach you some drum patterns. They range from fairly simple to really complicated. The idea is a good one. Where it falls down is that it has, by default, the drum backing track playing at the same time. You can turn this down in volume, but it is a distracting design decision. My ""bass"" drum pad is noticeably less responsive than the other 3. This leads to a bit of frustration as your hits aren't always registered. The pads seem nice rubber, but be aware, they will mark straight away - inherent in such a thing, but starts to look used immediately. There are built in tunes to play along with - more bontempi keyboard demo than Phil Collins. The pads are fairly small, and trying to keep up with the medium coaching mode had me hitting plastic rather than the drum pad. Taking of hitting, the sticks included are fine , plastic jobs, with just enough heft for this unit.This isn't a cheap unit, and I think I expected more quality than I got with it. My son played it once, and didn't use it again. Is it an intro to drumming? Any real interest in drumming will very very quickly leave this product wanting. You may be better off buying a good pair of drumsticks and getting some pillows, pots and pans, and investing in something more expensive. If you want a toy for your smaller kids to just bash at, this is fine, but that is all.",36

But it's not great. Other reviews mentioned a volume issue, and it's real. Sounds real easy to adjust the volume, and it is, except that it doesn't stay at that volume. Every time you switch songs or programs the volume goes back to the factory setting and you have to adjust it all over again. A simple rotary dial master is all it needs but nope, that's not what it has. If you are buying it as a gift for a kid it's fine. If you think this will make you a real drummer, or be good for practicing, think again. Many better options out there! If it was 1/4 the cost then maybe I'd be satisfied.

There are lots of things to do programmed in and playing the drums has a nice therapeutic value. The controls definitely have a learning curve. There is also quite a bit of noise ""static"" you can hear especially when wearing headphones. There is also no memory so you have to adjust the volume every time you turn it on. If they tuned that stuff up it would easily be 5 stars. It's still fun to learn/play the drums.",1

Should the meter show capacitance value?  I've spent hours online looking for information that should have been in Chapter 2.Same chapter - oscilloscopes - no mention that if buying digital, you'll need at least 12bit memory for audio work.  No explanation of why you need 100mhz (I found a deal on a 40mhz - will it be ok?) - The book is intended for beginners, yet does not give the information a beginner would need.",36

Do you really think that you can fix the circuit board on  your TV!  The book is forty years too late.Now, if you are an electronics hobbyist, already invested in equipment and knowledge, this book represents a chance for  you to expand your knowledge more broadly.

"How to Diagnose and Fix Everything Electronic, Second Edition",Electronics,nan,5.0,United States,2020-01-19,"I bought it to learn to fix broken electronics around the house. Something I was already doing on a very basic level already. (Cleaning corrosion out of battery compartments, replacing a power cord etc) While I think a beginner would need something more basic to get started this was an great book for people who have already dared to try to fix various kinds of broken equipment and have figured out the basics-sort of. He gives a lot of detail on using meters and some very technical basics. Then he gives plenty of great practical advice about what to look for where and when that has already saved me some time. There are also stories that demonstrate the thought process an experienced repair person goes through while hunting down a problem that help you get the mindset right. Not for the faint of heart but if you find yourself servicing parts inside stuff labeled ‘no user serviceable parts’ anyway you need this book to guide you through forbidden territory and you will come out victorious a lot more often.",0

"LG Electronics 27GN850 27 Inch Gaming Monitor (2560 x 1440) Nano IPS 1ms GtG, 144Hz, HDR10, G-SYNC Compatible, Black [Amazon Exclusive]",Electronics,nan,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-01-15,"The LG 27GL83A-B is a great 1440p IPS monitor that delivers great gaming performance. It has a very fast response time that delivers fast-moving content with almost no blur trail and has very low input lag. It is a cheaper, slightly less featured variant of the heralded and very well reviewed LG GL850 which is exclusive to another UK retailer. The only difference between this panel and that one is the GL83 has a slightly lower colour space due to the use of a different backlight and no USB ports on the back. That being said it still shows almost the entire sRGB colour space which is used by the majority of content.

The monitor comes pre-calibrated by the factory with a calibration report in the box, and with a slight tweak to the brightness (from 50 to 15) you can achieve a great colour temperature and fantastic accuracy. Additionally, the monitor comes with multiple overdrive modes to enhance pixel responsiveness, choose Fast, not Fastest, as the Fastest setting introduces horrific inverse ghosting and overshoot. The fast setting performs the best with fast transitions and very little blur or trailing.

Finally before wrapping up with pros and cons, you can see from my photo that I have it VESA mounted and I had no problems doing so on my Amazon Basics Dual monitor arm.

Pros
+ Fast response times with almost all pixel transitions within the 6.94ms window of 144hz.
+ 144hz IPS monitor 27""
+ VESA mountable (100x100)
+ Thin 1cm bezel on sides and top, slightly thicker on the bottom
+ Freesync monitor that is also Gsync compatible (works with AMD and Nvidia graphics cards)
+ Price (I paid £330 - which is stunning for an IPS 1440p 144hz monitor)
+ Colour accuracy
+ Great viewing angles
+ Excellent grey uniformity
+ Excellent gradient handling, no banding issues
+ Joystick style button to control the OSD is fantastically easy to use and navigate

Cons
- Claims to be HDR but peak brightness and lack of local dimming means its not really HDR
- Contrast ratio is 894:1 (Like other IPS it suffers in very dark scenes in a dark room but its not very noticeable and can be aided by using bias lighting behind the monitor)
- Lack of availability?

Other facts

This is a slightly slimmed down version of the 27GL850. The only difference really is the backlight and the USB hub, which is hardly useful anyway due to its location.

Screen quality is good, backlight bleed is non-existent and very subtle IPS glow in the corners.

DisplayPort 1.4 at 144Hz with G-Sync is glorious.

I’ve owned multiple monitors and was previously an award winning eSports gamer. I highly recommend this.",41

It depends how sensitive you are to player input and feedback. I didn't think i was but coming from a 144hz 1ms TN panel to this i COULD feel a slight difference in terms of responsiveness on fast paced shooters such as Modern Warfare and Doom Eternal.
The advertised 1ms GTG response IS THERE.... BUT.... only if you set the display to fastest settings which then introduces a hell of a lot of overshoot (trails in front of objects when moving). It was awful.

Dropping it back down to Fast setting it eliminated most of the blur but takes the panel to around 4ms GTG response time. Now i have not gamed on anything under 1ms in years and completely forgot what it was like but i could feel a difference on this.
The colours were great. It was nice to have freesync/G-sync (i'm on Nvidia GTX 1080) and the QHD resolution were superb. I will definitely be looking for these features in future. The unit i had came with no dead pixels (has to be a first that i have bought a monitor and not had to send it back due to dead pixels) and it had very little back light bleed in the bottom left corner. I would also say as another negative is that maybe IPS isn't for me 1. due to the 4ms response time but also 2. If you are a gamer and you play dark lit games such as Dead by Daylight, Resident evil 2 remake, Alien isolation etc. Anything where the game is made to be dark then i would steer clear and maybe look towards a VA or TN Panel (VA being superior in contrast and dark blacks but they come with their own problems too). The reason i say that is it can't display blacks as black. Playing Resident evil 2 remake the dark scenes all looked grey.

Another issue with the panel i had which is the MAIN reason for sending it back is when on fast moving games i noticed vertical lines down the screen. I have already packed it up but in hind sight i should of photographed these to show users. I searched the internet and i could not find anyone else who had these problems so this may be that my unit was faulty or had some issue. I couldn't put up with this is was really really bothersome and detracted from the image for me.

So all in all. If you don't mind the 4ms response time. You play big open world games or non fast paced shooters this is actually an amazing monitor. I played some Sea of Thieves on it and the colours just popped and it looked beautiful. the 2k resolution was beautiful and for the monitor itself it looked really smart and sleek on the monitor itselfs. Thin bezels etc. I wasn't a big fan of the stand, it was a bit too big for my liking.",36

Getting one of these is so hard on here. Finally they came back in stock and over the space of 10minutes stock went from 29 to 2 and thankfully I got it. I wish I'd got one sooner.
By far THE best monitor I've ever used or seen. It's just perfect. Amazing in everyway. I cannot express how happy I am with this.
It's like when I bought a Nvidia Shield TV I felt like I needed it all my life and mad at myself for not getting one the first time I had the chance.
If I had to pick anything wasn't as happy about is HDR400 really isn't HDR. But it does work great. Really unless your nit brightness is 1000 HDR will always suffer a bit. But it's implementation is very good. The new DOOM I'm playing 1440p 144hz. Locked and in HDR and wow is it good.
My son who plays Fortnite (don't they all) well as he said all day when he tried he was ""popping off"" the Fps, smoothness and 1ms response time just elevated his gameplay ability X10. Seriously though it really does in CSGO anything that requires fast movement it's a gamechanger. From 60fps. If you have the money and get the chance buy it.",11

It's easy to install and it has everything you need, rotation in different ways, height adjust and very intuitive and comfortable Menu to use.
When it comes to gaming and normal use it's just fantastic, it offers bright and amazing colors at 144Hz.
Even this monitor is a native 1080p 144Hz you can go beyond this on games!
I even tried to run some games with DSR setting from Nvidia Control Panel and game options at 1330p and 4k resolution with 144Hz, it still works with adaptive G Sync. I recommend this Monitor if you want play competitive games but also to enjoy nice graphic and colors in normal games.",8

You can easily see pixels. Another thing is very poor black and in my opinion very poor contrast. All the contrast measures are good only because of good brightness but real contrast is not so good. I decided to stay with my very old S23A750 monitor. I cannot even notice G-sync advantages.  I expected much more from this new model. The two things which are really good is colors and viewing angles. Unfortunately there is no black color and response time is not so impressive so in my opinion this is waste of money. You can see good things in this monitor only if you never had good monitor before.,10

You will often find through searching forums and reddit, that the LG 27GL850 is the one that people rate the highest and most sought after. However, finding them in stock is another issue all together. I paid £329.99, while comparing it to the GL850 (£100+ more expensive)Both the 27GL850 and 27GL83a share the same panel, build, freesync options amoung other things. The main difference is that the 27GL83a uses a different, cheaper backlight made for sRGB (standard dynamic range content) while the 27GL850 uses a new  backlight called NanoCell IPS. Essentially, they're the same panel, different backlight and backlight filter.The 27GL83A is a fantastic monitor, and I am very happy with it so far. I dont think you could go wrong in picking this monitor up. Would recommend this product.",11

Impressed by the build quality and the performance. Takes a bit of setting up if you want to use g-sync and / or HDR but both easy to do and fairly customisable within windows settings and the Nvidia control panel. Like the monitors onboard settings aswell ( have mine set to gaming one). HDR kinda sucks at the moment for anything other than playing games that support HDR but can't be bothered to turn it on/off all the time. Windows desktop looks awful in HDR ATM but imagine Microsoft will patch that eventually. Chrome also looks very grey in HDR so if you want to use HDR for browsing use Firefox. I would recommend leaving HDR off for now as the colour and brightness of this monitor is great without it and there is not a huge amount of games out that support HDR. Have used a TV as a monitor for years and would never go back after using this, if you have the GPU to achieve a high frame rate or want to use HDR on a games console then I highly recommend a nice monitor like this one.",3

There is also a bit more IPS glow on the left bottom corner of the screen, but this is more white and not as pronounced in my experience. The IPS glow on the left side seems to be a lot more common and more pronounced on average than my unit, but the right side I am finding more annoying as it can essentially see it all the time even when sitting around 2ft away from the monitor, due to the colour distortion it causes. This has become extremely distracting.On the plus side, everything else about the monitor is superb, especially for an IPS panel. There is little motion blur, very good input lag, very nice colour gamut, and the contrast ratio, while lacking, is still better than a TN panel. Plus maximum brightness is good enough for any situation. Also, the increase in resolution is great + the screen size gives me a lot more screen real estate. If you get a good unit, keep it.

I am not disappointed firstly this monitor is easy to put together all snap and play, so no tools needed and when I fired her up there were zero dead pixels. Playing games on this monitor is great (very smooth, no stuttering or tearing) and the display for everyday things (like writing this review) is very sharp. Recommend this monitor as an entry level into 144 Hz refresh rates, with a view to upgrading to a 240 Hz when they eventually come down in price......Especially as my GPU can easily support 240.....My only negative about this monitor is there is no adjustable height on it.....However I'm probably only 2cm off center but this could be remedied with a decent adjustable chair.

The other monitor sells for £499.99 now and it offers better colours and 2 extra USB ports. I've got both side by side and can tell you that the colours on the GL850 (not this monitor) look over saturated. The colours on this monitor (27GL83A-B) are less saturated and feel more natural. I've got my speakers connected to the monitor and I've had no issues with sound coming out my speakers (the monitor doesn't have a speaker itself).

One issue I do have is that, there is a harsh IPS glow/bleed at the bottom-left of the monitor and all 4 corners apply a blue tint. It's not noticeable until there's a dark colour present on the corners and right now, the bottom-left corner has the harshest glow and is visible while watching a video on YouTube in theatre mode.

Other than the normal IPS glow, there are no other issue and the 144Hz means a smoother UI experience.",1

G-sync kicked in as soon as it was connected (comes with Display port and HDMI cable), picture quality is great out of the box and it's very easy to assemble.

IPS, 144, 1 ms. Excellent performers, you can see the difference while you playing first or third person shooters.
The color accuracy are decent our of the box, but you can calibrate the monitor very easy with additional software.

Highly recommend this monitor if you are on a budget.

Quick note do not use the ""fastest mode"" on the monitor, other wise you will start see a lot of ghosting.
Use the preset for best experience.

I spent over a year researching monitors but nothing fit the bill (I was sure I wanted IPS for the colours but I also didn't like the response times until LG came out with this and the 27GL850). I've only had it a day but the 144Hz is noticeably smoother in games. Yet to try with an FPS but World of Tanks and Rocket League are much prettier for the colours and frame rate. I got it on sale at £385 but paid £310 as had an amazon voucher, pretty sure I couldn't have gotten a much better deal (I am blocking out the fact that I just missed the Black Friday price of £330). For the price I paid it's fantastic, and I now see they've put the price up to £500 which the 27GL850 is also currently available for.

There is no backlight bleed I can see, only IPS glow in the corners in dark scenes but if you view from slightly further away that disappears. The stand is slightly larger than I expected but the height and tilt adjustment is very handy for minimising the glow.

The screen seems slightly more reflective than my previous one - I notice the reflections more in my lit room in dark scenes, but maybe it's just because it now takes up so much more of my vision.

Overall a good purchase. I might be disappointed by the blacks if I paid over £450, though I knew from the beginning I was going to value response time over contrast which made this monitor an obvious choice. It's a beautiful image with any lit content.",4

I would have liked to have seen a plastic or cardboard handle on the outside of the box to help with carrying. This would mean a little extra money for the manufacturer to pay out but it would be worth it.

A good looking monitor with an adjustable stand. The menu is quite easy to use with the little joystick button under the front part of the monitor.

I have it connected to my Lenovo Legion Y740 laptop through the display port and it didn't required any tweaking, it just works. The colors are nice and bright, but also vivid. I bought it mostly for CSGO, but hey ... 144 Hz refresh rate is great in any app / game. It also works with AMD cards, as it supports FreeSync. To have all these, in a value proposition of under £300 from LG, is reallyu something I salute.For those of you who care about picture quality, I will say that it does a great job considering it is 1080p on a 27'' panel.

ORIGINAL REVIEW

Perhaps I was unlucky, but my monitor has a tonne of stuck pixels. Enough that it's not even worth trying to count how many there are. Though some of them are unnoticeable during actual use, more than a few are easily seen even whilst gaming

In terms of IPS glow and black light bleed, I am happy with the monitor. Picture quality and response times are also excellent. But I can't look past the terrible pixel issues and will be returning this faulty monitor and ordering another once they're back in stock. If the new one is of the quality I expect., I will update this review.

I was dead set on the GL850-B but as it was not available anywhere in the UK at the time I decided to take the plunge on the cheaper variant.

I must say I'm certainly glad that I did, the display is sharp and colour accurate, except for blacks but that's mostly a limitation of the technology. The response time is smooth and the Freesync works perfectly from my experience after a few months. The UI navigation and menu is very intuitive, the best I've experienced on a monitor.

There is a couple downsides, as with most monitors under £1000 the HDR is disappointing and generally not worth using. There is some small amount of IPS bleed but that's to be expected from the technology.

Gsync works out of the box perfectly and the colors are calibrated fairly accurately already. Response times and input lag are excellent for an IPS monitor. The contrast is the only aspect this monitor is a little behind in compared to the competition but it is better than TN panels and only slightly noticeable next to another IPS monitor if you are looking for it. If contrast is important to you rather opt for a VA panel but then you will have to deal with slower response times.

Sadly, upon setup of the monitor, I noticed that there was a yellow vertical line going down the middle of the monitor (as seen in the photo included) and despite trying a few different things such as switching DPP to HDMI, changing resolution, switching refresh rate, etc etc, nothing would eliminate the issue.

I've read up on the matter, and it seems that I am not the only one experiencing this issue with weird graphical defects on the monitor.

I am extremely disappointed, especially given how long I have been waiting for it to arrive.",1

Gorgeous display. So many features for the money. The 1ms thing is a bit of marketing. If you watch reviews on this monitor it recommends you dont use the fastest setting due to ghosting. But unless ur a pro gamer and have well tuned eyes this is still a great Monitor with good refresh rates and a whole host of features.To the person who criticised this monitor for its recessed Vesa mount. Check the bag that came with your Duronic stand. It should have washers and longer screws to accommodate such recesses. Thats a point for Duronic too.,0

Sadly it is not freesync compatible as when I opened up Radeon settings on my pc is said it is not supported which was surprising as it is advertised as a freesync compatible monitor in the description. Not too mad though as I am planning on going from a rx 580 to a gtx 1080ti or rtx 2070s soon but am a little upset I cant currently use the full potential of the monitor.,0

Previously tried the Pixio Prime PX7, wasn't happy with the response time on that one. LG definitely wins here. 144hz , excellent response time, great colours and accuracy + nvidia gsync. Great choice for FPS or games with quick changing scenery e.g. flight simulators.

With a bit of calibration it's excellent for multimedia work - managed to colour match my dell so they look almost identical.

Also featuring probably the most intuitive OSD I've seen with a handy little joystick mechanism.",0

One followed by a further 2. For the price these are a cracking monitor. Colours and brightness are good. No dead / stuck pixels on any of them

When I compare to my old TN panels from approaching 20 years ago these are superb. The whites are white (my previous whites were more yellow than white and I just hadn't really noticed).

I need a better graphics card to drive them properly - which is coming in the next week or so. Then I can try out G-Sync/FreeSync

No backlight bleed or dead/stuck pixels. There is however some notable ips glow on the bottom left and top left in dark imagery. Cant notice it on coloured content.

The power cable supplied is short. You may want to buy extensions if a power plug is far away.

The stand is sturdy however takes too much desk-space to the point it overlaps my mouse pad. It wouldn't be as much of a problem if it had side to side adjustments.",1

I know that Backlight Bleed and IPS Glow is something that is going to be present with every IPS panel, unless you go premium or OLED. Having owned multiple laptops, monitors etc, this is the first time I experienced so bad IG, that it made me do a refund.
Also to get 144Hz on HDMI, you have to disable Adaptive Sync and HDR. In theory HDR should be available through HDMI, but I experienced bat flickering when it was turned on. I had to either turn it off or go lower to 120Hz.

Apart from the one major deal breaking issue, and the other minor one with HDMI, the monitor is fantastic for gaming. Butter smooth. The HDR is decent and the colours look great.

Make sure you check right after you buy for any serious light bleed and also make sure you can connect with display port instead of HDMI to unlock the monitors full potential. If both boxes check. Then you have a great monitor on your hands.",3
