"TePe Oral Health Care, Interdental Brush, Mixed Pack, 8 Pieces",Health Care,nan,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-07-26,I used to order the different coloured brushes in separate packs but I have found it much more practical to order the individual pack of assorted brushes.  There is a size for every gap in your teeth which ensures proper cleaning.  This is a very good quality product.,0
"TePe Oral Health Care, Interdental Brush, Mixed Pack, 8 Pieces",Health Care,nan,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-01-02,Fine it you have different size gaps between your teeth. Cheaper to buy a big pack of one or two different sizes if you are not going to use all of the different sizes.,0

"NRS Healthcare M15691 Portable Overbed/Chair Table - Tilting, Adjustable and Wheeled",Health Care,nan,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-05-02,"Im finally organised! Wish I‚Äôd got this 6 weeks ago....

Working from home during Lockdown (office on the bed LOL) it‚Äôs taken me ages setting up / breaking down my kit everyday, but not anymore!

It only took a few minutes to assemble, without needing any tools. The A4 instruction sheet is in large readable text, using step-by-step notes & photos.

One niggle about the instruction sheet - the bars supporting the table top have 2 retractable buttons holding them in place, not one as shown in the photos & notes!

I set up my Surface Pro laptop, an external hard drive, desk fan, reading light AND I still have space on the table top to use my mouse!

Being right-handed, my laptop is on the left hand side of the table, with the fulcrum point (law of physics) furthest away - so you get ‚Äúbounce‚Äù when typing - not enough to be an issue, but when doing long reports or letters, it might make me move the laptop over to the right side / lessen the distance to the down supports = less bounce!

The surface is sealed / wipe clean (not sure why other reviews mention a papery surface?)

The table top is side-edged with a black plastic shielding which doesn‚Äôt sit very ‚Äòproud‚Äô of the surface - maybe 1mm or 2mm - meaning mouse control / typing is still comfortable while resting your arms across the edge.... but the ridge isn‚Äôt high enough to stop items sliding off, especially if you‚Äòre using the table top at a slightly tilted angle - perfect for my use, but might be an issue for people wanting the table top to retain items / stop pens rolling off!

Tilting the top to an angle takes a couple of seconds & fixes firmly in place - again perfect for my use (mouse control / typing / reading)

Still can‚Äôt believe the value for money on this purchase - sturdy, robust, easy to manoeuvre and a large working area!

Absolutely love it!!",13
"NRS Healthcare M15691 Portable Overbed/Chair Table - Tilting, Adjustable and Wheeled",Health Care,nan,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-05-30,Purchased for a member of the family who had a seven weeks stay in hospital and now recovering at home.Excellent purchase which looks similar to the one in the hospital.  Used for meal times and also using for resting books and phone.  The tilting feature has not been used yet so can't comment on that.  Excellent portability and wheels run smoothly from bed to chair.  It also fits nicely around the bed and chair.Perfect size and not to small and not too big.  This is recommended,3
"NRS Healthcare M15691 Portable Overbed/Chair Table - Tilting, Adjustable and Wheeled",Health Care,nan,4.0,United Kingdom,2020-01-04,"Good product and easy to assemble.
Wipes clean easily, including frame.
Top a but slippy so maybe need a job slip mat (I use a tray on top for Mum incase she spills anything (.
Easy to +/- height for over chair/bed.
Be careful if you have tubes (oxygen piping) etc as they can get caught round legs/height adjusters.
Pleased overall - meal times much easier.",0

"NRS Healthcare M15691 Portable Overbed/Chair Table - Tilting, Adjustable and Wheeled",Health Care,nan,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-04-04,A lovely idea. Only just fit over the side of a hospital bed.

"NRS Healthcare M15691 Portable Overbed/Chair Table - Tilting, Adjustable and Wheeled",Health Care,nan,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-06-09,Purchased this for use as a laptop stand and it's been great.

"NRS Healthcare M15691 Portable Overbed/Chair Table - Tilting, Adjustable and Wheeled",Health Care,nan,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-06-15,"I brought this to help with working from home. Really easy to build, great at moving its smooth and plenty of leg room due to be able to move it up and down. I was worried it wouldnt go high enough but definitely does.

Also use it for diamond art, colouring and reading .",0

"NRS Healthcare M80282 Kura Care Easy Grip Children's Cutlery Set, Multi-Colour",Health Care,10.99,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-02-16,"Junior still can't hold a spoon at 2.5 years, has developmental delay and sensory issues amongst other things and always big issues around food generally. For some reason he uses finger and thumb to hold cutlery /really weak fist if we're lucky and ends up turning it upside down before it reaches his mouth (again for unknown reasons!) He also won't touch most food so we end up feeding him, but given his age he's been point blank refusing as he's craving control but just can't manage it. We've tried EVERYTHING...or so we thought!

The shape of this set has just meant he has managed to stab tomatoes and strawberries, scooped omelette and yoghurt and SOME MADE IT TO HIS MOUTH rather than his lap! We did iiiiiit!!!

Also arrived in a couple of days and the colours are appealing to children. The edges are curved so risk of injury is less, but the knife actually does cut and the fork is still pointed enough to actually get through food such as tomato skins, peppers etc.

We have had such stress around mealtimes recently and it sounds dramatic but it's honestly helped a situation that was starting to make the whole family miserable and dread mealtimes. Thank you so much!",3

"Oxbow Animal Health Critical Care, Herbivore, Apple-Banana Flavor, 141 Gram Bag",Health Care,nan,5.0,United States,2020-01-06,"Before moving to Florida from NY Ik bought this as a safe measure, just in case... well the whole way there I was extremely worried, he started to stop eating and acting weird, lethargic, panting, no interest, stoped pooping and peeing. I started to force feed him this. It was a little hard to mix up, and stayed a bit chunky. But other than that. The minute we arrived to my new apartment, we dropped everything off, and rushed him to the vet. It was a very big vet bill, and he had to stay over night. But the vet said that if it weren‚Äôt for this he would have already been dead. I owe it to this company, it saved his life. Definitely buy this to at least keep on hand, it‚Äôs hard to find in stores, and when you need it there‚Äôs nothing you can do, and things can go downhill very quickly.",0
"Oxbow Animal Health Critical Care, Herbivore, Apple-Banana Flavor, 141 Gram Bag",Health Care,nan,5.0,United States,2020-07-02,"I have used the carnivore care variety for sick bearded dragons, baby beardies, kittens, and used this version for a sick baby bunny. Everyone rallied quickly after having this without any negative side effects. My vet recommended it. I keep it on hand in the freezer in case any foundlings come to the house. I think it's funny that the review asks you to rate the flavor, but the bearded dragon won't answer me when I ask him about that, so I just gave it 5/5. The cat begs for it, so that's a good sign. It smells like armpit, though.",0
"Oxbow Animal Health Critical Care, Herbivore, Apple-Banana Flavor, 141 Gram Bag",Health Care,nan,5.0,United States,2019-12-16,"My rabbit Chubbs had GI Stasis back in October and this helped bring him out of it. He ended up sick again with something else 3-4 weeks ago. The vet couldn‚Äôt figure out what was wrong. I went ahead and bought more of this and it kept him going. He has since passed, but I do recommend this product. It gives them what they need to help when they are sick. Still see a vet as medications can be required, but this will help with nutrition and getting water in them since you mix with water. I have a spare bag just in case our other rabbit ends up needing it. Chubbs did like the taste. He gobbled it up while he was sick last.",0

I start itching ...uncontrollably !  I‚Äôm single ... haven‚Äôt been intimate with anyone ...asking myself what the hell is happening down there?!?  Not just itching but also breaking out in acne ...down there!!  This has been going on for months!!  Can‚Äôt get into a doctor because of COVID-19....so I start researching and I find that ...all the symptoms of bacterial vaginosis appear to be what I‚Äôm experiencing.  I took the pill as soon as I got them in the mail...about 4pm in the afternoon.  I swear to the gods....by 9pm ...I wasn‚Äôt itching at all !  I felt more normal than I had in months !  I wanted to cry !  I‚Äôve been taking them for a week and it just keeps getting better everyday!  And the acne is going away as well!  I‚Äôm using vagisil as a backup because my sanity can‚Äôt even tolerate the slightest itch right now and I‚Äôm also using this great product that is a discreet antiperspirant designed especially for your private areas... that has helped tremendously while I‚Äôm suffering through the hot flashes and night sweats.

My roommate said she'd been taking vaginal probiotics with great results (less yeast infections after her period, more lubrication, etc), but given I already take 50bil cfu probiotics for gut health, I thought it was hoopla. Until now.

Over the past several months, when I start sweating even a little, everything smells. I would walk from my car to work, and get a whiff of myself. After working out or running with friends, I'd be too embarassed to hang around. I could shower before bed, and still need to shower when I get up. I carried extra deo, underwear, and feminine wipes in my purse, gym bag, desk, work backpack. You get the idea. With summer here I was begrudgingly prepared to keep this routine. I'd talked to my gynecologist who had found nothing amiss.

3 days taking these, I noticed a difference, but didn't want to jinx it. 2 weeks in, and I have to say these have changed my life. I don't stink when I sweat, and I don't have to keep a whole bathroom in my purse! No reapplying deo multiple times a day, no multiple showers when I'm not leaving the house! I told my girlfriends all about the probiotics, and they've hopped on the bandwagon. This is totally worth the money.",22

No panty liner needed to stay fresh and everything goes back to normal on its own after sex after about a day.

I've had a 10 year long battle with depression and I have tried everything under the sun. Most things do not work. I've also tried other probiotics and I have not felt like this ever.

(All my paps were normal my whole life, I was checked out) So I assume that my goofed up cycle was contributing to my long bout of anxiety...and then my anxiety messed up my Ph levels, because I got a BAD and STUBBORN yeast infection. 4 days of diflucan at first, then it came back, or lingered for 2 weeks after. I went to P.Parenthood because, still had a discharge. She looked under the microscope,  YEAST. Miserable. She prescribed me a higher dose of diflucan that I took once every 4 days, instead of each day in a row. That did the trick.However, things still were not of normal smell down there, actually, it was a lack of smell. As if there was no good bacteria. Discharge was dry. I battled this thing for a month and a half. It was SO upsetting which of course made my mental health feel way worse. My husband is usually supportive but he was sick of hearing me complain. I was just done, so I found these. Took for a month straight. WOW. What a game changer. My mood was lifted a little bit, and everything back to normal down there. Yes the diflucan did help, but this is what brought the Ph back to balance. The yeast infection did not come back!Since, I started self hypnotherapy. Not only is my lifelong intermittent anxiety 90% better, but my sex drive is back and my vagina is back to it's dapper self. I FEEL SO MUCH BETTER. Thanks garden of life!",2

"The 6-Minute Diary | Gratitude Journal for Men & Women, Mindfulness Journal | 6 Minutes a Day for more Self Care, Mental Health & Happiness",Health Care,nan,1.0,United Kingdom,2020-01-05,I persevered with this for a couple of months but found it really tricky to use. I couldn‚Äôt think of anything to write without being repetitive. I had to look online for positive affirmations after I‚Äôd constantly repeated the limited few I could think up myself. I am very grateful for many things in my life but I couldn‚Äôt think of enough to keep the diary interesting and repeated the same few things over and over again. Doing a good deed every day is tricky when you work alone most of the time so I had to put down daily jobs such as cooking dinner for me and my husband or walking the dogs. After about two months of repetitive writing I felt that the diary had provided me with absolutely no benefit at all. I prefer taking a walk with my dogs or spending time outdoors in my garden when the weather is good. That had a far better effect on my mind and sense of well-being. This may work for some people but I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it to anyone I know because my friends and family are quite similar to me and they wouldn‚Äôt know what to write.,6

Large portion of the diary is dedicated to talking about self improvement and is full of inspirational stories etc almost like a novel, this eats into paper which could have been used as actual diary space. I threw this out after a week of trying to use it. If I wanted a novel I'd have bought one. This doesn't fall under the category of diaries  - you'd be as well taking a piece of paper and writing three things you feel grateful for in the morning as that's really the only thing this offers (and you'd save yourself a heap of Money).",4

This diary has some reading at the beginning to explain how it works and evidence to back it up. You then begin with a little self assessment scoring everything from your overall mood to finances and relationships from 1 to 10. You will repeat this month by month and it‚Äôs a good way to see how you change.This is a very structured gratitude journal which makes it easy to do. Literally 3 mins in the morning and 3 mins in the evening. What you are grateful for, a positive affirmation in the morning and similar in the evening. There are weekly questions that really make you think.I loved this diary. It has changed my life for the better. It has a habit tracker and has helped me now also incorporate daily meditation into my life.I recommend this to anyone, struggling or not.

"The 6-Minute Diary | Gratitude Journal for Men & Women, Mindfulness Journal | 6 Minutes a Day for more Self Care, Mental Health & Happiness",Health Care,nan,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-06-30,I decided to buy this after a very traumatic experience. My mental health was suffering and I felt I needed to focus on looking at the positive things. This has helped me so much. It doesn‚Äôt take much time so I don‚Äôt feel overwhelmed by it. It is good to journal things that have happened in more detail but focus on the little positive steps towards recovery as well as realising I have a lot to be grateful for. I have also used it as a daily focus for my 14 year old son but he does it verbally. It‚Äôs lovely to hear him talk about things he is grateful for. It has helped us both understand that even when life seems really tough there are things to be grateful for and great things still happen. It makes me think of the saying ‚ÄúEnjoy the little things because one day you will look back and realise that they were the big things‚Äù. I have found this so useful for the last six months that I have now bought the follow on version to continue for the next six months. I would recommend this to anyone who is struggling and perhaps may feel overwhelmed by having to write a lot each day. This is meant to only take 3 minutes in the morning and another 3 minutes at night but there is space to record longer thoughts at the end of each week and at the back of the planner. It‚Äôs really good.,1
"The 6-Minute Diary | Gratitude Journal for Men & Women, Mindfulness Journal | 6 Minutes a Day for more Self Care, Mental Health & Happiness",Health Care,nan,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-02-03,"I bought this to go with a couple of books for my children (the 5 minute diary for the eldest and the 3 minute one for the younger child)... My initial objective was to get them to be grateful for their dinner... even if it's NOT chicken nuggets... be grateful you have food, you have warmth, you have comfort, even if the dinner had REAL chicken in it, as well as mushrooms!!! ... and that seemed to work, we got over that, not entirely of course, but a lesson has been learned (somewhat) in that department...
The unexpected by product of this experience however, is that THIS book grabbed my attention... it's not 'just' a gratitude journal which you write stuff down, it's the preamble, it's the all the information up front - the bit about why you're doing it in the first place...
That's what hooked me...
And then practicing the ritual with my daughters each day.
And at first, it was clutching at the obvious; grateful for food, water, clothes, warmth
But then something started to change, unexpectedly so... I started to dig deeper and feel more positive...
My gratitude now involves; realising my self worth and what I mean to my children, recognising what we have, not what we don't, grateful for opportunities and more meaningful, deeper reflection when it comes to positive affirmations....and one of my good deeds today, was simply 'Acceptance'... and 'Acceptance with grace'...
I love this book.
I have recommended and even bought copies for friends and colleagues...
I am more positive, more energised, more determined and dare I say happier in myself... I didn't even realise I needed changing, my days had been focused on other people and things and work and jobs which needed doing, that I forgot myself along the way. But I'm back now... and it feels great :)",2

Specially if you are already a little bit of a positive person.Won't recommend it at all unless you are some sort of masochist that takes insane pleasure of writing (and answering) the same things time after time after time.,2
"The 6-Minute Diary | Gratitude Journal for Men & Women, Mindfulness Journal | 6 Minutes a Day for more Self Care, Mental Health & Happiness",Health Care,nan,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-07-01,"I am absolutely hopeless with sticking to new things that are good for me long-term, whether it's eating healthily or exercising - but this is brilliant. It's such an easy habit to get into, as it requires minimal time input and no equipment (well, other than a pen). I mean, who doesn't have a few minutes each day?

When I first started using it, I found it incredibly difficult to think of good deeds for the day or good things that happened during the day, which says a lot in itself, but this makes me more aware of the good going on in life. I still struggle occasionally, but like the fact that this forces me to find the positive. It's making me noticeably more positive as time goes on and I've recommended it to lots of my friends and colleagues.

If you're on the fence about buying it, I'd ask 'what have you got to lose?'. I'm sure you've spent more on other potential 'fads' in the past, but this is a long-term investment, that doesn't go off or go to waste. Go for it!",2

This has helped a lot but often the negative thoughts far outweigh the good.

This diary has already helped me. I‚Äôve used it less than a week but the timing to write.. first thing in the morning and last thing at night give perfect opportunity to start and end the day better.
My old pattern was to remember the sad aspects too much.
I‚Äôm the kind of person that recognises things I‚Äôm grateful for often but then during a difficult day or hour, it‚Äôs all too easy to push my feelings of great fullness to the back of my mind. Therefore the negative thoughts take over.

Do read all the pages before starting to write the diary. They are incredibly helpful to understand why you should write and ideas of what will be helpful to write.

I‚Äôm also incredibly interested in psychology and this ticked my box for personal interest too, as well as helping me personally.",1

It‚Äôs interesting to look back and see how far I‚Äôve come in my personal development over the past 6 months.

You can definitely tell that UrBestSelfTruly cares about the practice of positive wellbeing! This book is not just about being positive, but also improving yourself in all aspects of your life! This diary will definitely give you all the advice and growth you need to become the person you want to be!! There‚Äôs a few pages in the beginning with inspirational advice and facts, then there‚Äôs the diary itself which is so quick to write in. I feel so motivated every day to write in it because it makes me feel so good in the morning and night. This book is perfect to look back at as well and see how far you‚Äôve come/ what you‚Äôve done in the year etc. Plus, this would be an amazing and caring gift if you‚Äôre thinking about it.. Or even gift it to yourself to start your new year right!!",0

I read some people weren‚Äôt keen on the price and that we could of done that ourselves but really who has the time for that? Because I know I definitely don‚Äôt so 6 minutes of my time in the morning and at night is not asking much and everything is all there for me to fill out, I would definitely recommend this especially if you have finished a course of CBT like I have.

I'm sure I'm not alone in this. However, since committing to completing the diary each morning and evening (using some initial willpower to overcome resistance), I now view making entries as an enjoyable habit that I look forward to. The creator of the diary has obviously put a lot of time, effort, and kindness into bringing this diary to the market, and I'd like to thank them for all their efforts. Compared to what people could, and do, spend ¬£20 or so on, this diary is an excellent investment considering the benefits it can bring. I'm delighted to have found it.",0

For years now I‚Äôve known that there‚Äôs great value in self reflection and gratitude, but just couldn‚Äôt find a way to fit this into my daily/weekly routine without it feeling like really hard work. Until I bought this journal. I love the way this book breaks down the various elements into small chunks and makes it interesting and easy to do.  I actually look forward to filling it in every day, and the accompanying information gives you great insight as to why you‚Äôre doing it. It‚Äôs not the cheapest option, but I think this stands head and shoulders above the rest.",0

So far really enjoying doing this each day and it really does take a few minutes, of course it can take longer some days when i really struggle to remember the positives to recount. But it is already making me more optimistic and positive, and less of the hum-drum of daily grind/hamster wheel.  I have also enjoyed asking my  year old son what are WE going to do to make the day great. The daily positive affirmation does also make you feel stronger, I've been told this many a time but just  never been in the habit of writing it down or thinking about it. This is a great reminder.

It has a lovely hardback cover and the pages are of good quality (I write in this using my fountain pen). It took quite a while to read the introduction which is very detailed but this did give some useful insight. I read in someone else‚Äôs review that there were a few spelling and grammar mistakes - I haven‚Äôt noticed these but even so, I believe that the journal was originally written in German and translated so I think it just adds to the charm.I will definitely order another one when I have completed this as my whole outlook on life is already changing.",0

This book has helped me break habits I had been carrying around for years and has also helped me to create new healthier habits. I have struggled with depression for years and even after finally getting a hold on it I still could not let go of negative thinking and behaviour.

It has a significant reading 'buy in' to begin with that of course can be optional. This buy in covers some of the science behind gratitude and useful tips and tricks to implement it into your life.
My gratitude has improved and this noticeably permeated into my everyday life.
The weekly questions are fantastic and provoke introspection yet only take a few minute to complete.
I have just bought the follow up '6MD pure' and I look forward to using it daily.

I absolutely love this so far! There is a very lengthy intro to the book but it is full of information for you to get the most out of using this diary.

The best recommendation I can give is that I have bought the follow up Pure. Like the daily quotes and the gratitude practice really makes a difference to not taking things for granted which can so easily be the case with our natural tendency for hedonic adaptation.One bit of feedback would be to include some more real life examples if possible for people just starting out so they can ease into things. Certainly took me longer than 3mins for the morning routine in the beginning which slightly hinders habit formation. I got there in the end and everyone will find what works for them from using this journal and tutorial bit at the start. Enjoy! X",0

I used the first version for 6 months and have now started on the Pure edition. This takes your thinking to the next level. There are suggested guidelines, but really it's up to you to decide what you want to focus on, in terms of Gratitude in your day. In a busy world, where time is of the essence, to sit down in the morning with a cuppa and consider what/who you are greatful for is a positive way to start the day. Similarly to reflect in the evening brings everything together. I was reviewing my first journal and it brought back happy memories of the small things that made me smile, in a big life that sometimes doesn't. I've found this process invaluable for my postive mental health. Highly recommended.",0

I found being prompted to think in this way very jarring at first. It's completely contrary to how my brain works, which is why I need it. It's very simple to do and not too full of the usual self help tropes that catch in my cynical throat. I wish I'd discovered this earlier, the effect was instant and is becoming stronger with practice. I haven't missed a day yet and it has never felt like a chore.",1

I‚Äôm not really one for self-help so when I was given it as a birthday gift, I smiled and said thanks and forgot about it for nearly 6 months. Then I had a mental health breakdown. I found the diary by accident and decided to try. The guidance at the beginning really resonated but for the first week I found it really hard. The hardest part was the affirmation- not my thing at all. To tackle this, I chose to find a daily affirmation on Instagram that spoke to me that day.Six months on and I‚Äôm the happiest and most at peace than I‚Äôve ever been.

The only thing I can recommend that they change is the ink colour/font, the ink is just too pale on grey paper and the font could be a bit bigger, maybe 11 pitch.

I gave myself a week to read through the introduction and familiarise myself with how I should be using this day and night, I am not great at expressing myself so this was great assistance.

I love the great quotes and the variety of questions it asks you each week. It reduces the repetitive feeling each day.

I have been using the product for roughly three weeks now and am pretty sure I will buy another one once the six months are up.

Only thing I can complain about is where do I put my pen?
A nice little loop pen holder would be a nice upgrade.",2

"The 6-Minute Diary | Gratitude Journal for Men & Women, Mindfulness Journal | 6 Minutes a Day for more Self Care, Mental Health & Happiness",Health Care,nan,5.0,United States,2020-01-08,"I love this daily journal. I was nervous about getting something like this for myself because I‚Äôm not used to journaling everyday but I found the prompts short and easy to incorporate in my daily routine. It really does take 6 minutes each day (3 in the am, 3 in the pm). I do however worry that I will get tired of the same 6 daily propers after a few months, but overall I think they are great ways for me to express gratitude, start on a positive note, and mentally organize my day. My favorite things about the daily are the weekly prompts and the reading section at the beginning. The Diary starts with evidence based research that shows why adding this to your daily routine helps. I loved that it answered a lot of my questions and worries about being able to keep up with the journal and gave me helpful tips for starting new and healthier habits such as journaling. The weekly prompts also help break up the daily routine by fostering reflection. They change week to week which is really nice.

"The 6-Minute Diary | Gratitude Journal for Men & Women, Mindfulness Journal | 6 Minutes a Day for more Self Care, Mental Health & Happiness",Health Care,nan,5.0,United States,2020-01-24,"Having just completed using the 5 Minute Journal for the past six months, I was looking for an alternative to carry on this great practice I developed. I landed on this book, The 6 Minute Diary.

First, I will say that I am completely surprised that the authors were able to publish this book because of its similarities to the 5 Minute Journal. The introduction section is nearly identical, but it was a good refresher.

The differences: I absolutely love the monthly habit trackers. The 5 Minute Journal doesn‚Äôt have these and it‚Äôs a nice addition. Additionally, there is a space to capture weekly notes. I love having extra space to jot down highlights throughout the week.

This book was an easy transition from the 5 Minute Journal with a few extra bonuses.

These books have absolutely changed my life. My husband commented that I wake up in a better mood and I‚Äôve noticed I have developed a more positive and grateful outlook on life.

If you decide to purchase it, I hope it brings you as much joy as it does for me!",22

Makes my life easier with two kids and allows me to pump whilst doing other things. Holds pump in place so no spills, better when standing than sitting. Ordered a Large after reading reviews, I‚Äôm a 36E and it fits perfectly, not as fitted after I drain my boobs but still stays put and holds the pump. Wish I‚Äôd found this sooner.

"Medela Women's Easy Expression Bustier - for Comfortable, Hands-Free Breast Pumping, Compatible with All Medela Breast Pumps",Health Care,20.99,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-07-25,"I‚Äôve had it for a couple of weeks, and for me it‚Äôs a game changer. Makes pumping a much nicer experience. I agree with other reviewers who said it looks funny, and haven‚Äôt had it for long enough to determine whether it loses shape/expands too much (as I‚Äôve seen on one review), but so far I can‚Äôt fault it. It‚Äôs super comfortable to wear, holds everything in place, and does the job! I use it with a Medela Swing Flex pump (single sided). I would definitely recommend getting it if you use anything similar, to free yourself from holding the bottle while pumping (with the medela I can walk around and do stuff now, as the pump‚Äôs motor is a tiny machine that, when battery operated, can be clipped onto the bra).",1

I love my medela pump and I adore their sleep bras so I thought this would be perfect for pumping at work, but the problem arises when you want to take it off but have bottles full of milk attached. The best solution is to un screw the bottles then take off the bra, but I found the flanges leaked the last drops of milk onto me and the whole experience is messy. I don‚Äôt know what the alternative solution is for a pumping bra but I don‚Äôt bother and just hold the pump.",0

The zipper + stretch is a BAD combination and the zipper is nearly impossible to get up.  Once I did get it on though (after a 15 minute struggle) it did work and did fit OK.  Either their sizing chart is wrong or the zipper design is just bad.  May spring for a different brand.",1

A complete game changer for me! The bra keeps my pump in place perfectly as it‚Äôs a nice snug fit. I wear the large and am a 36DD.

I use the Medela electric pump, and was finding it to be an absolute pain because if you slip just slightly you spill valuable milk, plus your hands are glued to the pumps so you are incapacitated for however long you pump for. This bra means you have your hands back and you don't spill milk. The fit is snug but really comfortable and most importantly keeps the flanges in place. I am a 36C and got a medium.

Two courses of antibiotics didn‚Äôt help at all. I‚Äôd post some before and after pics but nobody wants to see that. Pretty horrific 4 inch open wound. Bought this in desperation and, within 3 days, the wound was clearing up beautifully.

This stuff is easy to apply and doesn‚Äôt distress her at all. Looks to be doing exactly what it promises - kill bacteria and promote healing without pain. Will keep an emergency supply.

Not even 6 hours after the grass being cut they had both started to scratch and chew their paws.

I have tried many many creams and spray over the years, including various (expensive) treatments from the vet and even the use of steroids for one of them as she had got so bad she was going bald with all her itching!

My male had managed to scratch a horrible sore onto his stomach area, I had tried treating it with another well- known dog anti itch brand for several days with no luck what so ever and figured it was going to have to be another vet trip before the cut turned into a full-blown wound and would get infected. I had seen this spray advertised several times but to be honest, I just assumed it would be the same as all the others I already have sitting in the cupboard which didn't work for us. However, when telling a friend I was going to have to take him back to the vet she recommended trying Leucillin Antiseptic Skin Care Spray and told me her vet uses it and that she had had great results too so decided it was worth a go.

Item arrived really quickly and spraying it onto the cut didn't seem to bother him at all. Within a day the sore had already started to look better. Even better my dog was no longer scratching at the area or trying to constantly lick it. Have used the spray for 3 days (twice a day although it does recommend 3 times) and today the area has completely healed and no longer red or sore. My other Maltese hasn't been as bad (so far) this year however she has been chewing at her paws a bit. I have given her feet a quick spray once a day and that alone seems to be enough to stop her biting and causing more harm.

Am truly amazed by how well it has worked, although have to say I'm a little annoyed I didn't purchase it sooner as I would have saved the dogs many summers of itching misery and myself many large vet bills!",3

"The 6-Minute Diary Pure | Gratitude Journal, Mindfulness Journal for Men & Women | 6 Minutes a Day for more Mental Health, Happiness & Self Care",Health Care,nan,5.0,United Kingdom,2019-12-26,"I absolutely love this product.  I started with the Six Minute Diary but was rather half-hearted about it - thinking it couldn't possibly be just six minutes a day... but it arrived and I filled it in that day ... and the next day... and the next day...I loved the daily quotes/affirmations;  I loved the fact that the statements/questions are simple and straightforward and didn't make it feel like an exam or that there was a ""wrong answer"".  I just love it.So much that as I filled it in one day.. then the next... then the next... I came to the end of it.  I was delighted and disappointed all at the same time... so I immediately ordered the Six Minute Diary Plus... and am very much looking to not only continuing my morning and evening ""journalling"" (which has improved my focus on my life, my goals, what I will accept and what is unacceptable to me) and I have high hopes that ""Plus"" will allow me to continue to start and end each day in a positive, productive, pro-active mindset - which has had a massive beneficial impact on so many other aspects of my life.I'm going to end here because I know I'm beginning to sound evangelical about it... but I really can't recommend it highly enough.  Buy it and tell yourself ""I'll give it my best shot for a week""... don't look at the whole book and think I'll never get to the end... just tell yourself ""seven days"".  That's what I did... but the first seven days were followed by the second seven days.. then the third ... and the fourth... and ... on those days where I couldn't fill it in first thing (with a cup of coffee in bed) ... I missed it.  My day didn't ""start right""... and on those rare occasions where I couldn't end my day positively reflecting on all the good things that had happened... I went to sleep with my heart that little bit less content .. and I couldn't hear my soul singing the lullaby that the diary created every evening.Buy it.  Try it.  I hope, like me, you'll love it.",4
"The 6-Minute Diary Pure | Gratitude Journal, Mindfulness Journal for Men & Women | 6 Minutes a Day for more Mental Health, Happiness & Self Care",Health Care,nan,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-01-29,"I bought this to go with a couple of books for my children (the 5 minute diary for the eldest and the 3 minute one for the younger child)... My initial objective was to get them to be grateful for their dinner... even if it's NOT chicken nuggets... be grateful you have food, you have warmth, you have comfort, even if the dinner had REAL chicken in it, as well as mushrooms!!! ... and that seemed to work, we got over that, not entirely of course, but a lesson has been learned (somewhat) in that department...
The unexpected by product of this experience however, is that THIS book grabbed my attention... it's not 'just' a gratitude journal which you write stuff down, it's the preamble, it's the all the information up front - the bit about why you're doing it in the first place...
That's what hooked me...
And then practicing the ritual with my daughters each day.
And at first, it was clutching at the obvious; grateful for food, water, clothes, warmth
But then something started to change, unexpectedly so... I started to dig deeper and feel more positive...
My gratitude now involves; realising my self worth and what I mean to my children, recognising what we have, not what we don't, grateful for opportunities and more meaningful, deeper reflection when it comes to positive affirmations....and one of my good deeds today, was simply 'Acceptance'... and 'Acceptance with grace'...
I love this book.
I have recommended and even bought copies for friends and colleagues...
I am more positive, more energised, more determined and dare I say happier in myself... I didn't even realise I needed changing, my days had been focused on other people and things and work and jobs which needed doing, that I forgot myself along the way. But I'm back now... and it feels great :)",13
"The 6-Minute Diary Pure | Gratitude Journal, Mindfulness Journal for Men & Women | 6 Minutes a Day for more Mental Health, Happiness & Self Care",Health Care,nan,4.0,United Kingdom,2020-04-25,"I got a lot out of the first volume of The 6-Minute Diary.  It helped me, a natural pessimist, to take stock of and appreciate the good things in life just by asking me a few simple (and yes, repetitive) questions every single day, with a weekly set of deeper questions that ultimately helped me think about what was important in life to me.  This second volume is useful for keeping that positivity and gratitude going. I gave it only 4 stars because the weekly reflection, which I used to find sometimes challenging but definitely enlightening, has been replaced by a 'lighter' version, although I can see that it is still useful. Overall I have found that creating the habit of thinking about the positives in life, however small, has been really beneficial for me.",0

Also just want to say that woman who uploaded pictures of the worst case scenario complications of this product is being completely silly, I mean it's exactly the same principle when you take any medication, they say 1 in 10,000 MIGHT suffer a reaction so pffttt. I've not started barking yet so I'm pretty sure it's safe AND I have healthy nails... *neigh*",43

The hibiclens was amazing, after one day of using it i saw the biggest results, the stubborn spots on my face was shrinking and my pores were smaller than ever. BUT make sure you‚Äôre not using this everyday. Use it at night every 2 days as it could make your face more sensitive and it can worsen your face but if used the right way it could make you look amazing!",8

"Hibiscrub Health Care, 500ml",Health Care,7.50,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-03-26,"Thankfully, I thought about this product as soon as the virus that we all want to be eradicated raised its head. Well, this was probably my best purchase for sanitising my hands. This gel is antiseptic and given it is used before conducting surgery and minor operations, I think it's effectiveness is unquestionable.

I am very thorough when washing my hands and usually rub the gel into my hands for around 3 minutes, with close attention to all areas and under the nails. However, the peace of mind afterwards is fantastic, as even though I take a sanitizer with me too, you feel ""bulletproof"" knowing this product has a residual effect for up to 6 hours!

The smell is pleasant and I have not had any allergic reaction despite having sensitive skin. However, this handwash is not cheap but you get what you pay for, so the peace of mind is worth every penny!!!",4

I started using it after multiple hospital visits some years ago and haven't stopped, keeping a bottle around for anything from treating skin problems to general hand washing. If I could find fault, it's that this 500ml bottle doesn't come with a dispenser top, so you'll most likely need to pour it into a more handy bottle, but the smaller versions come with pour tops so get one of those and then one of these once the smaller is finished.",0

The antibacterial effects last around six hours according to product info. Eliminates bo after work outs and while family members who do not use have been beset by winter colds I have not sucumbed  which has never happened previously.

This kit has all the essential items you need for a newborn. Best is the ear cleaner as it has a small torch light in it. Only item I didn't like is the hair brush. It's soft but the bristles come off easily every time I use it on my baby's hair. But overall its a great useful kit box. Cheaper than the big brands and does the job you need.,1

"Boxclever Press Luxury A5 Diary Cover. Textured Cover with Zip for A5 Diaries & Journals. Untitled Diary Covers for Nurses, Health Care Professionals, Students or Home Use. (Seaspray)",Health Care,19.99,2.0,United Kingdom,2020-01-15,"Solid with stiff board inside and the faux leather material appears quite thick. The general construction and sewing appears very good. However the item is lacking in finesse. Velcro on small pocket not aligned, so does not hold closed. However this is academic since the  pocket is not of any use.! More important, the zip, although solid, is very rough making it-for me- unusable; it jams sometimes unless I am very careful and deliberate. It reminds me of zips from 40 years ago. There is binding next to the zip. Rather than using one piece, the manufacturers have continued with a join which is unsightly and has a black mark on it. Overall the fit is tight even with a 12 cm thick A5 notebook. with a 20 mm spiral wire spine, placed inside. Personally I would have prefered if it were 5-10 mm thicker.  I am disappointed, mainly because of the zip.",3

"Wright's Traditional Coal Tar Soap 002629, 500 gram, Pack of 4",Health Care,4.24,4.0,United Kingdom,2020-04-20,"I procured a pack of these heading into the CV19 era as a backup, thinking that there would come a time when, bereft of all liquid soap, all fragrant latherings, we would be forced to turn native, to return to the scent of coal tar soap....

I had to turn to it sooner than I ever expected..... The increased washing with the Blue scented liquid soap did no favours to my delicate digits. Dryness and itchiness setting in irrespective of how much Scandinavian hand cream I applied twixt scrubbing.

I started on the Wright's and immediately knew the Right choice had been made...

I was catapulted back to childhood days....that smell...it lingers....and I remember

No more dryness, no more itchy prickly pinkies....just a dab of hand cream and life is good...

However......the department of infernal affairs, (she who must be listened to..)..despises the smell....but I've been allowed to keep my bar of Wright's in a sealed box, by the sink. ...for now...

The minute we arrived to my new apartment, we dropped everything off, and rushed him to the vet. It was a very big vet bill, and he had to stay over night. But the vet said that if it weren‚Äôt for this he would have already been dead. I owe it to this company, it saved his life.

He has since passed, but I do recommend this product. It gives them what they need to help when they are sick.

My roommate said she'd been taking vaginal probiotics with great results (less yeast infections after her period, more lubrication, etc), but given I already take 50bil cfu probiotics for gut health, I thought it was hoopla. Until now.

Over the past several months, when I start sweating even a little, everything smells. I would walk from my car to work, and get a whiff of myself. After working out or running with friends, I'd be too embarassed to hang around. I could shower before bed, and still need to shower when I get up. I carried extra deo, underwear, and feminine wipes in my purse, gym bag, desk, work backpack. You get the idea. With summer here I was begrudgingly prepared to keep this routine. I'd talked to my gynecologist who had found nothing amiss.

3 days taking these, I noticed a difference, but didn't want to jinx it. 2 weeks in, and I have to say these have changed my life. I don't stink when I sweat, and I don't have to keep a whole bathroom in my purse! No reapplying deo multiple times a day, no multiple showers when I'm not leaving the house! I told my girlfriends all about the probiotics, and they've hopped on the bandwagon. This is totally worth the money.",22

No panty liner needed to stay fresh and everything goes back to normal on its own after sex after about a day.

I‚Äôve quit eating sugar. I‚Äôve done Keto and low carb and I even tried intermittent fasting. Nothing ever seemed to work.

(All my paps were normal my whole life, I was checked out) So I assume that my goofed up cycle was contributing to my long bout of anxiety...and then my anxiety messed up my Ph levels, because I got a BAD and STUBBORN yeast infection. 4 days of diflucan at first, then it came back, or lingered for 2 weeks after. I went to P.Parenthood because, still had a discharge. She looked under the microscope,  YEAST. Miserable. She prescribed me a higher dose of diflucan that I took once every 4 days, instead of each day in a row. That did the trick.However, things still were not of normal smell down there, actually, it was a lack of smell. As if there was no good bacteria. Discharge was dry. I battled this thing for a month and a half. It was SO upsetting which of course made my mental health feel way worse. My husband is usually supportive but he was sick of hearing me complain. I was just done, so I found these. Took for a month straight. WOW. What a game changer. My mood was lifted a little bit, and everything back to normal down there. Yes the diflucan did help, but this is what brought the Ph back to balance. The yeast infection did not come back!Since, I started self hypnotherapy. Not only is my lifelong intermittent anxiety 90% better, but my sex drive is back and my vagina is back to it's dapper self. I FEEL SO MUCH BETTER. Thanks garden of life!",2

"The 6-Minute Diary | Gratitude Journal for Men & Women, Mindfulness Journal | 6 Minutes a Day for more Self Care, Mental Health & Happiness",Health Care,nan,1.0,United Kingdom,2020-01-05,I persevered with this for a couple of months but found it really tricky to use. I couldn‚Äôt think of anything to write without being repetitive. I had to look online for positive affirmations after I‚Äôd constantly repeated the limited few I could think up myself. I am very grateful for many things in my life but I couldn‚Äôt think of enough to keep the diary interesting and repeated the same few things over and over again. Doing a good deed every day is tricky when you work alone most of the time so I had to put down daily jobs such as cooking dinner for me and my husband or walking the dogs. After about two months of repetitive writing I felt that the diary had provided me with absolutely no benefit at all. I prefer taking a walk with my dogs or spending time outdoors in my garden when the weather is good. That had a far better effect on my mind and sense of well-being. This may work for some people but I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it to anyone I know because my friends and family are quite similar to me and they wouldn‚Äôt know what to write.,6

This diary has some reading at the beginning to explain how it works and evidence to back it up. You then begin with a little self assessment scoring everything from your overall mood to finances and relationships from 1 to 10. You will repeat this month by month and it‚Äôs a good way to see how you change.This is a very structured gratitude journal which makes it easy to do. Literally 3 mins in the morning and 3 mins in the evening. What you are grateful for, a positive affirmation in the morning and similar in the evening. There are weekly questions that really make you think.I loved this diary. It has changed my life for the better. It has a habit tracker and has helped me now also incorporate daily meditation into my life.I recommend this to anyone, struggling or not.

Large portion of the diary is dedicated to talking about self improvement and is full of inspirational stories etc almost like a novel, this eats into paper which could have been used as actual diary space. I threw this out after a week of trying to use it. If I wanted a novel I'd have bought one. This doesn't fall under the category of diaries  - you'd be as well taking a piece of paper and writing three things you feel grateful for in the morning as that's really the only thing this offers (and you'd save yourself a heap of Money).",4

Despite reading negative reviews I made the purchase.. The first 60 pages are uncomfortable to read - kind of reminds me of a poorly written leaflet someone would hand you about God. Once you get passed this, the diary is only 66 pages long and has terribly chosen quotes from the likes of Richard Branson? Love the idea of this book as it is something I practice daily already - but terribly executed to the point of embarrassing, unfortunately.",5
"The 6-Minute Diary | Gratitude Journal for Men & Women, Mindfulness Journal | 6 Minutes a Day for more Self Care, Mental Health & Happiness",Health Care,nan,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-02-03,"I bought this to go with a couple of books for my children (the 5 minute diary for the eldest and the 3 minute one for the younger child)... My initial objective was to get them to be grateful for their dinner... even if it's NOT chicken nuggets... be grateful you have food, you have warmth, you have comfort, even if the dinner had REAL chicken in it, as well as mushrooms!!! ... and that seemed to work, we got over that, not entirely of course, but a lesson has been learned (somewhat) in that department...
The unexpected by product of this experience however, is that THIS book grabbed my attention... it's not 'just' a gratitude journal which you write stuff down, it's the preamble, it's the all the information up front - the bit about why you're doing it in the first place...
That's what hooked me...
And then practicing the ritual with my daughters each day.
And at first, it was clutching at the obvious; grateful for food, water, clothes, warmth
But then something started to change, unexpectedly so... I started to dig deeper and feel more positive...
My gratitude now involves; realising my self worth and what I mean to my children, recognising what we have, not what we don't, grateful for opportunities and more meaningful, deeper reflection when it comes to positive affirmations....and one of my good deeds today, was simply 'Acceptance'... and 'Acceptance with grace'...
I love this book.
I have recommended and even bought copies for friends and colleagues...
I am more positive, more energised, more determined and dare I say happier in myself... I didn't even realise I needed changing, my days had been focused on other people and things and work and jobs which needed doing, that I forgot myself along the way. But I'm back now... and it feels great :)",2
"The 6-Minute Diary | Gratitude Journal for Men & Women, Mindfulness Journal | 6 Minutes a Day for more Self Care, Mental Health & Happiness",Health Care,nan,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-06-30,I decided to buy this after a very traumatic experience. My mental health was suffering and I felt I needed to focus on looking at the positive things. This has helped me so much. It doesn‚Äôt take much time so I don‚Äôt feel overwhelmed by it. It is good to journal things that have happened in more detail but focus on the little positive steps towards recovery as well as realising I have a lot to be grateful for. I have also used it as a daily focus for my 14 year old son but he does it verbally. It‚Äôs lovely to hear him talk about things he is grateful for. It has helped us both understand that even when life seems really tough there are things to be grateful for and great things still happen. It makes me think of the saying ‚ÄúEnjoy the little things because one day you will look back and realise that they were the big things‚Äù. I have found this so useful for the last six months that I have now bought the follow on version to continue for the next six months. I would recommend this to anyone who is struggling and perhaps may feel overwhelmed by having to write a lot each day. This is meant to only take 3 minutes in the morning and another 3 minutes at night but there is space to record longer thoughts at the end of each week and at the back of the planner. It‚Äôs really good.,1
"The 6-Minute Diary | Gratitude Journal for Men & Women, Mindfulness Journal | 6 Minutes a Day for more Self Care, Mental Health & Happiness",Health Care,nan,1.0,United Kingdom,2020-07-23,It's overpriced for what it is.After a couple of weeks of usage it becomes very very repetitive. Specially if you are already a little bit of a positive person.Won't recommend it at all unless you are some sort of masochist that takes insane pleasure of writing (and answering) the same things time after time after time.,2
"The 6-Minute Diary | Gratitude Journal for Men & Women, Mindfulness Journal | 6 Minutes a Day for more Self Care, Mental Health & Happiness",Health Care,nan,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-07-01,"I am absolutely hopeless with sticking to new things that are good for me long-term, whether it's eating healthily or exercising - but this is brilliant. It's such an easy habit to get into, as it requires minimal time input and no equipment (well, other than a pen). I mean, who doesn't have a few minutes each day?

When I first started using it, I found it incredibly difficult to think of good deeds for the day or good things that happened during the day, which says a lot in itself, but this makes me more aware of the good going on in life. I still struggle occasionally, but like the fact that this forces me to find the positive. It's making me noticeably more positive as time goes on and I've recommended it to lots of my friends and colleagues.

If you're on the fence about buying it, I'd ask 'what have you got to lose?'. I'm sure you've spent more on other potential 'fads' in the past, but this is a long-term investment, that doesn't go off or go to waste. Go for it!",2

This has helped a lot but often the negative thoughts far outweigh the good.

This diary has already helped me. I‚Äôve used it less than a week but the timing to write.. first thing in the morning and last thing at night give perfect opportunity to start and end the day better.
My old pattern was to remember the sad aspects too much.
I‚Äôm the kind of person that recognises things I‚Äôm grateful for often but then during a difficult day or hour, it‚Äôs all too easy to push my feelings of great fullness to the back of my mind. Therefore the negative thoughts take over.

Do read all the pages before starting to write the diary. They are incredibly helpful to understand why you should write and ideas of what will be helpful to write.

I‚Äôm also incredibly interested in psychology and this ticked my box for personal interest too, as well as helping me personally.",1

It‚Äôs interesting to look back and see how far I‚Äôve come in my personal development over the past 6 months.

So far really enjoying doing this each day and it really does take a few minutes, of course it can take longer some days when i really struggle to remember the positives to recount. But it is already making me more optimistic and positive, and less of the hum-drum of daily grind/hamster wheel.  I have also enjoyed asking my  year old son what are WE going to do to make the day great. The daily positive affirmation does also make you feel stronger, I've been told this many a time but just  never been in the habit of writing it down or thinking about it. This is a great reminder. An it's a lovely bound book too, a bright turquoise to brighten the day :)",0

It has a significant reading 'buy in' to begin with that of course can be optional. This buy in covers some of the science behind gratitude and useful tips and tricks to implement it into your life.
My gratitude has improved and this noticeably permeated into my everyday life.
The weekly questions are fantastic and provoke introspection yet only take a few minute to complete.
I have just bought the follow up '6MD pure' and I look forward to using it daily.

For those worrying about the price, how much are you willing to pay for a proven method to improve your happiness for 6 minutes of input a day + an extra 5 minutes for questions once a week.",0

I definitely see this item working for only a particular type of person. I would not call myself lazy but I found the repetitive questions everyday kinda hard and boring to answer but I am writing this during quarantine where I am self-isolating at home so it will try to use it again after I go back to work. There are a good few quotes and explanations at the start that was kinda repetitive and I did not finish reading them but I can say that the exercise itself did out me in a positive mood instantly. maybe a bit too expensive for the book.,0

I absolutely love this so far! There is a very lengthy intro to the book but it is full of information for you to get the most out of using this diary.
I'm certain it will be easy to stick to as the daily inputs are brief - but get you thinking.

The book itself is stunning - pages are thick which will be ideal for the entries. Very stury design.

The best recommendation I can give is that I have bought the follow up Pure. Like the daily quotes and the gratitude practice really makes a difference to not taking things for granted which can so easily be the case with our natural tendency for hedonic adaptation.One bit of feedback would be to include some more real life examples if possible for people just starting out so they can ease into things. Certainly took me longer than 3mins for the morning routine in the beginning which slightly hinders habit formation. I got there in the end and everyone will find what works for them from using this journal and tutorial bit at the start. Enjoy! X",0

I have never before managed to stick with a journal, but this one asks the important questions and I actually looked forward to completing it each morning and evening.  It may seem expensive, but much thought has gone into creating it, and it is made of top-quality materials.  I'm a convert.",1

"The 6-Minute Diary | Gratitude Journal for Men & Women, Mindfulness Journal | 6 Minutes a Day for more Self Care, Mental Health & Happiness",Health Care,nan,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-01-03,"I love this diary/journal. I used the first version for 6 months and have now started on the Pure edition. This takes your thinking to the next level. There are suggested guidelines, but really it's up to you to decide what you want to focus on, in terms of Gratitude in your day. In a busy world, where time is of the essence, to sit down in the morning with a cuppa and consider what/who you are greatful for is a positive way to start the day. Similarly to reflect in the evening brings everything together. I was reviewing my first journal and it brought back happy memories of the small things that made me smile, in a big life that sometimes doesn't. I've found this process invaluable for my postive mental health. Highly recommended.",0

I found being prompted to think in this way very jarring at first. It's completely contrary to how my brain works, which is why I need it. It's very simple to do and not too full of the usual self help tropes that catch in my cynical throat. I wish I'd discovered this earlier, the effect was instant and is becoming stronger with practice. I haven't missed a day yet and it has never felt like a chore.",1

Was a bit sceptical but have found it so helpful especially in the present climate of covid-19 that I have sent it as a gift to several friends. I have just completed the book and purchased the follow on diary to continue my journey.

My progress from the start to the end despite lockdown and a world pandemic is proof of benefit.,1

What an amazing book! I have only completed about 5-6 days so far, but I am already feeling really inspired and motivated.

I‚Äôm not really one for self-help so when I was given it as a birthday gift, I smiled and said thanks and forgot about it for nearly 6 months. Then I had a mental health breakdown. I found the diary by accident and decided to try. The guidance at the beginning really resonated but for the first week I found it really hard. The hardest part was the affirmation- not my thing at all. To tackle this, I chose to find a daily affirmation on Instagram that spoke to me that day.Six months on and I‚Äôm the happiest and most at peace than I‚Äôve ever been. The diary won‚Äôt do this alone but it‚Äôs been my compass for getting there.",0

It forces you to reflect, think about what you want, what are you unhappy about, what you can change, etc. - it's a great start to 2020 and I enjoy doing it morning and night.  The only thing I can recommend that they change is the ink colour/font, the ink is just too pale on grey paper and the font could be a bit bigger, maybe 11 pitch.  I really like it and I'm thrilled that my wife did her homework in finding it for me!!",0

I gave myself a week to read through the introduction and familiarise myself with how I should be using this day and night, I am not great at expressing myself so this was great assistance.

I love the great quotes and the variety of questions it asks you each week. It reduces the repetitive feeling each day.

I have been using the product for roughly three weeks now and am pretty sure I will buy another one once the six months are up.

Only thing I can complain about is where do I put my pen?
A nice little loop pen holder would be a nice upgrade.",2

If you are someone who doesn‚Äôt have a lot of time and still wants to take a moment this is a great option.

"The 6-Minute Diary | Gratitude Journal for Men & Women, Mindfulness Journal | 6 Minutes a Day for more Self Care, Mental Health & Happiness",Health Care,nan,5.0,United States,2020-01-24,"Having just completed using the 5 Minute Journal for the past six months, I was looking for an alternative to carry on this great practice I developed. I landed on this book, The 6 Minute Diary.

First, I will say that I am completely surprised that the authors were able to publish this book because of its similarities to the 5 Minute Journal. The introduction section is nearly identical, but it was a good refresher.

The differences: I absolutely love the monthly habit trackers. The 5 Minute Journal doesn‚Äôt have these and it‚Äôs a nice addition. Additionally, there is a space to capture weekly notes. I love having extra space to jot down highlights throughout the week.

This book was an easy transition from the 5 Minute Journal with a few extra bonuses.

These books have absolutely changed my life. My husband commented that I wake up in a better mood and I‚Äôve noticed I have developed a more positive and grateful outlook on life.

If you decide to purchase it, I hope it brings you as much joy as it does for me!",22
"The 6-Minute Diary | Gratitude Journal for Men & Women, Mindfulness Journal | 6 Minutes a Day for more Self Care, Mental Health & Happiness",Health Care,nan,5.0,United States,2020-01-08,"I love this daily journal. I was nervous about getting something like this for myself because I‚Äôm not used to journaling everyday but I found the prompts short and easy to incorporate in my daily routine. It really does take 6 minutes each day (3 in the am, 3 in the pm). I do however worry that I will get tired of the same 6 daily propers after a few months, but overall I think they are great ways for me to express gratitude, start on a positive note, and mentally organize my day. My favorite things about the daily are the weekly prompts and the reading section at the beginning. The Diary starts with evidence based research that shows why adding this to your daily routine helps. I loved that it answered a lot of my questions and worries about being able to keep up with the journal and gave me helpful tips for starting new and healthier habits such as journaling. The weekly prompts also help break up the daily routine by fostering reflection. They change week to week which is really nice. I also like the weekly challenges - a great way to add some positivity or new things in your week. I highly recommend this diary. It‚Äôs also a great gift for someone who like journaling or is on a personal journey.",2

"NRS Healthcare M15691 Portable Overbed/Chair Table - Tilting, Adjustable and Wheeled",Health Care,nan,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-05-02,"Im finally organised! Wish I‚Äôd got this 6 weeks ago....

Working from home during Lockdown (office on the bed LOL) it‚Äôs taken me ages setting up / breaking down my kit everyday, but not anymore!

It only took a few minutes to assemble, without needing any tools. The A4 instruction sheet is in large readable text, using step-by-step notes & photos.

One niggle about the instruction sheet - the bars supporting the table top have 2 retractable buttons holding them in place, not one as shown in the photos & notes!

I set up my Surface Pro laptop, an external hard drive, desk fan, reading light AND I still have space on the table top to use my mouse!

Being right-handed, my laptop is on the left hand side of the table, with the fulcrum point (law of physics) furthest away - so you get ‚Äúbounce‚Äù when typing - not enough to be an issue, but when doing long reports or letters, it might make me move the laptop over to the right side / lessen the distance to the down supports = less bounce!

The surface is sealed / wipe clean (not sure why other reviews mention a papery surface?)

The table top is side-edged with a black plastic shielding which doesn‚Äôt sit very ‚Äòproud‚Äô of the surface - maybe 1mm or 2mm - meaning mouse control / typing is still comfortable while resting your arms across the edge.... but the ridge isn‚Äôt high enough to stop items sliding off, especially if you‚Äòre using the table top at a slightly tilted angle - perfect for my use, but might be an issue for people wanting the table top to retain items / stop pens rolling off!

Tilting the top to an angle takes a couple of seconds & fixes firmly in place - again perfect for my use (mouse control / typing / reading)

Still can‚Äôt believe the value for money on this purchase - sturdy, robust, easy to manoeuvre and a large working area!

Absolutely love it!!",13

Makes my life easier with two kids and allows me to pump whilst doing other things. Holds pump in place so no spills, better when standing than sitting. Ordered a Large after reading reviews, I‚Äôm a 36E and it fits perfectly, not as fitted after I drain my boobs but still stays put and holds the pump. Wish I‚Äôd found this sooner.

"Medela Women's Easy Expression Bustier - for Comfortable, Hands-Free Breast Pumping, Compatible with All Medela Breast Pumps",Health Care,20.99,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-07-25,"I‚Äôve had it for a couple of weeks, and for me it‚Äôs a game changer. Makes pumping a much nicer experience. I agree with other reviewers who said it looks funny, and haven‚Äôt had it for long enough to determine whether it loses shape/expands too much (as I‚Äôve seen on one review), but so far I can‚Äôt fault it. It‚Äôs super comfortable to wear, holds everything in place, and does the job! I use it with a Medela Swing Flex pump (single sided). I would definitely recommend getting it if you use anything similar, to free yourself from holding the bottle while pumping (with the medela I can walk around and do stuff now, as the pump‚Äôs motor is a tiny machine that, when battery operated, can be clipped onto the bra).",1

I love my medela pump and I adore their sleep bras so I thought this would be perfect for pumping at work, but the problem arises when you want to take it off but have bottles full of milk attached. The best solution is to un screw the bottles then take off the bra, but I found the flanges leaked the last drops of milk onto me and the whole experience is messy. I don‚Äôt know what the alternative solution is for a pumping bra but I don‚Äôt bother and just hold the pump.",0

The zipper + stretch is a BAD combination and the zipper is nearly impossible to get up.  Once I did get it on though (after a 15 minute struggle) it did work and did fit OK.  Either their sizing chart is wrong or the zipper design is just bad.  May spring for a different brand.",1

A complete game changer for me! The bra keeps my pump in place perfectly as it‚Äôs a nice snug fit. I wear the large and am a 36DD.

I use the Medela electric pump, and was finding it to be an absolute pain because if you slip just slightly you spill valuable milk, plus your hands are glued to the pumps so you are incapacitated for however long you pump for.

Everything is fine but I wouldn‚Äôt buy again or reccomended to other parents. The Hairbrush is nice and gentle but a bit Plasticky, the nail cutters are ok but we found that they weren‚Äôt sharp enough and actually bought a small high quality pair which is way more effective, the nose sucker is way too big for a newborn and not that great later on (we ended up buying the Braun electric one after trying various other solutions). The comb is just a comb. We haven‚Äôt used the scissors. The only thing of any use is the thermometer, you can just buy one from a pharmacy as save the money and in end we ended up getting a forehead one when our daughter was 9 months because she wouldn‚Äôt stay still long enough to check her under the arm. So all in all a nice idea but a waste of money as we either didn‚Äôt use things or we bought better alternatives down the line.",9

"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",Health Care,nan,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-05-23,This grooming kit would be an ideal gift for any parent to be. It has more or less everything you would need. Super easy to use and comes in a pouch which you can take anywhere with you. Baby scissors are perfect for trimming nails. The brush and comb set are food quality bristles are nice and soft. The only thing I didn't like from the kit was the nasal aspirator there is hardly any suction on there and did not clean her nose at all couldn't pull anything out. We ended up buying the snuffle babe nasal aspirator which is amazing. I would still recommend this grooming kit as it is worth the price as everything else is really good.,1
"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",Health Care,nan,3.0,United Kingdom,2020-04-11,"I bought this set because I thought I'd get good value for money and use most of the pieces, but nope. The opening of the nasal aspirator is definitely too big for a newborn, it was even too big for our baby when he had a cold when he was three months old. The nail clipper is too sharp, but I find the scissors are great. I used the brush a few times, but never the comb (though maybe you will if your baby has lots of hair). The thermometre is ok, though pretty slow. All in all, unless you could really use the case (it is handy for travelling), just buy the things you'll really use separately.",0

"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",Health Care,nan,1.0,United Kingdom,2019-12-18,"Awful quality, there's nothing in this set that can actually be used. I had to buy every single item separately. I'll give you a few reasons for not buying this product. 1. The nail clip blade is extremely sharp and presents some irregularities. I've tried to cut my newborn nails and just by touching it cut my baby's skin, haven't even pressed on it. Checking it on with my finger I have realised it's too sharp. 2. Baby brush and comb... seriously? Those are not suitable for delicate baby skin, the bristles are too strong. 3. Digital thermometer - that should be posed under baby's arm or mouth to give the temperature... that's a joke. First of all, baby is wriggling too much and it's impossible to keep the thermometer in position under arm for around 1 minute. Secondly, you can't make the baby keep the mouth shut for a better temperature measurement... otherwise, I've tested on my own mouth and was giving a result of 34deg Celsius which is impossible. 4. Nose cleaner - there are better products out there that can actually do the job. 5. Nail file - single use. 6. Teeth brush for newborn and baby? The brush has plastic bristles which are not suitable for baby that can chew and swallow. Unfortunately, I cannot return it as I bought this product long time in advance before the baby was born. But please make yourself a favour and avoid buying this.",0
"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",Health Care,nan,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-02-28,"Great little kit, especially when you have a newborn with a cold. I love the small Emery boards to help keep those sharp little nails down. The only thing that I find fiddly is the thermometer which you have to hold in place for quite some time to get an accurate reading.",0
"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",Health Care,nan,1.0,United Kingdom,2020-03-12,The most important item in this kit is the thermometer. My baby is poorly and I went to take his temperature and the thermometer is dead. The first time I come to use it and the battery dies. Really unacceptable given that I need to take his temperature in an emergency.,0
"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",Health Care,nan,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-05-22,Bought to get the thermometer as they were very difficult to get hold of at the time. Gave the rest to a friend who was expecting. She was very pleased.,0
"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",Health Care,nan,1.0,United Kingdom,2020-05-08,"Honestly just cheap and useless tat made solely to feel like a worried mum and dad to be are prepared. When push comes to shove and you need it with a newborn, this stuff is useless. There is place in hell reserved for whoever thought the thermometer would work for a wriggly newborn. Cheap tat. Avoid.",0

"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",Health Care,nan,3.0,United Kingdom,2020-01-11,"This pack is just as every other pack like this you can find. Yes it‚Äôs practical, but he brush is not very soft, and the items are not great quality. If it‚Äôs all you can afford yes it does the job but I do advise in buying the items separated instead . My thermometer does not seem very accurate either.",0
"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",Health Care,nan,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-05-30,Perfect little health care pack for your baby. Everything is easy to use and I find it most useful. The nail clippers are great and the little hair brush is excellent for cradle cap. We haven't used many of the other items yet but I'm sure we will. It's a great kit.,0
"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",Health Care,nan,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-06-27,"A great thing to have in the drawer for your newborn. It‚Äôs has everything you need any more to get you started.

I‚Äôm not thrilled with the thermometer, although it does get the job done. I think I will spend more on a better one in the future (more than what the whole kit costs).

The brush leaves my daughters hair lovely and the nail clippers work a treat.",0
"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",Health Care,nan,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-04-04,Great little kit for our little one the scissors are handy for cutting her small finger nails and the rest of the kit seems OK from what we have used.,0
"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",Health Care,nan,3.0,United Kingdom,2020-02-12,"It's a set, yes handy to keep all the goods in one place, but my disappointment is with the fact hat some of the items don't really work.... Thermometer is bad, not showing correctly, the nose pump is too big for a baby nostrils. I wouldn't buy 5his again",0
"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",Health Care,nan,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-07-02,This is a gift for our newest arrival.  Good pack of needed tools easy to use and store.

"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",Health Care,nan,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-05-12,"Has everything you need for baby, although I mainly use the thermometer/files/clippers...baby doesn‚Äôt have any hair so we don‚Äôt use the brush yet..I let baby suck/chew on the toothbrush as he‚Äôs only 4 months but he likes it on his gums.

"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",Health Care,nan,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-06-20,"It actually is good. When I first saw the scissors, I decided that they are complete useless and didn't even attempt to use them. Then 4 months later decided to try them out and realised that they actually are great for baby nails.",0
"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",Health Care,nan,2.0,United Kingdom,2020-07-01,"Quality is okay I only use the scissors for my new born baby which I love , I tried to use the nose sucker but I feel that the thing is too big nor a newborn baby nose so I couldn't use it , the brush I feel that is not soft enough maybe for an older baby is better .",0
"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",Health Care,nan,3.0,United Kingdom,2020-01-09,"Expensive for what it is and the thermometer takes so long to read it is pointless, unless your baby never moves you will not be able to get their temperature.",0

"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",Health Care,nan,3.0,United Kingdom,2020-06-22,"Before having my son, I thought I  would use all the products but I didn't. I mostly use the nail clipper, comb, brush and emergy board. The thermometer is okay but I prefer the thermometer which goes in the ear as I think that gives the best results and I have noticed many doctors using thermometers that go in the ear as well. The Nasal Aspirator is way too big especially to use on a baby that is under 2 months. And the toothbrush is not soft at all. I think its better to buy individual products rather than the whole set.

I laughed, then had more wine and thought ahhh... Go on, and my goodness what a brilliant product! If your toenails are yellow, brittle... One could say like a horse hoof.... Then, this product is for you. Also just want to say that woman who uploaded pictures of the worst case scenario complications of this product is being completely silly, I mean it's exactly the same principle when you take any medication, they say 1 in 10,000 MIGHT suffer a reaction so pffttt. I've not started barking yet so I'm pretty sure it's safe AND I have healthy nails... *neigh*",43

The hibiclens was amazing, after one day of using it i saw the biggest results, the stubborn spots on my face was shrinking and my pores were smaller than ever. BUT make sure you‚Äôre not using this everyday. Use it at night every 2 days as it could make your face more sensitive and it can worsen your face but if used the right way it could make you look amazing!",8

"Hibiscrub Health Care, 500ml",Health Care,7.50,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-03-26,"Thankfully, I thought about this product as soon as the virus that we all want to be eradicated raised its head. Well, this was probably my best purchase for sanitising my hands. This gel is antiseptic and given it is used before conducting surgery and minor operations, I think it's effectiveness is unquestionable.

I am very thorough when washing my hands and usually rub the gel into my hands for around 3 minutes, with close attention to all areas and under the nails. However, the peace of mind afterwards is fantastic, as even though I take a sanitizer with me too, you feel ""bulletproof"" knowing this product has a residual effect for up to 6 hours!

The smell is pleasant and I have not had any allergic reaction despite having sensitive skin. However, this handwash is not cheap but you get what you pay for, so the peace of mind is worth every penny!!!",4

I started using it after multiple hospital visits some years ago and haven't stopped, keeping a bottle around for anything from treating skin problems to general hand washing. If I could find fault, it's that this 500ml bottle doesn't come with a dispenser top, so you'll most likely need to pour it into a more handy bottle, but the smaller versions come with pour tops so get one of those and then one of these once the smaller is finished.",0

"Lictin Baby Health Care Kit - Baby Grooming Kit Newborn Baby Care Accessories, 15PCS Safety Cutter Nail Care Set",Health Care,14.99,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-07-05,It's a great deal. This kit has all the essential items you need for a newborn. Best is the ear cleaner as it has a small torch light in it. Only item I didn't like is the hair brush. It's soft but the bristles come off easily every time I use it on my baby's hair. But overall its a great useful kit box. Cheaper than the big brands and does the job you need.,1

The introduction to the psychology behind the diary makes sense and is backed up by scientific journals you can look up yourself.

"The 6-Minute Diary | Gratitude Journal for Men & Women, Mindfulness Journal | 6 Minutes a Day for more Self Care, Mental Health & Happiness",Health Care,nan,5.0,United States,2020-01-24,"Having just completed using the 5 Minute Journal for the past six months, I was looking for an alternative to carry on this great practice I developed. I landed on this book, The 6 Minute Diary.

First, I will say that I am completely surprised that the authors were able to publish this book because of its similarities to the 5 Minute Journal. The introduction section is nearly identical, but it was a good refresher.

The differences: I absolutely love the monthly habit trackers. The 5 Minute Journal doesn‚Äôt have these and it‚Äôs a nice addition. Additionally, there is a space to capture weekly notes. I love having extra space to jot down highlights throughout the week.

This book was an easy transition from the 5 Minute Journal with a few extra bonuses.

These books have absolutely changed my life. My husband commented that I wake up in a better mood and I‚Äôve noticed I have developed a more positive and grateful outlook on life.

If you decide to purchase it, I hope it brings you as much joy as it does for me!",22
"The 6-Minute Diary | Gratitude Journal for Men & Women, Mindfulness Journal | 6 Minutes a Day for more Self Care, Mental Health & Happiness",Health Care,nan,5.0,United States,2020-01-08,"I love this daily journal. I was nervous about getting something like this for myself because I‚Äôm not used to journaling everyday but I found the prompts short and easy to incorporate in my daily routine. It really does take 6 minutes each day (3 in the am, 3 in the pm). I do however worry that I will get tired of the same 6 daily propers after a few months, but overall I think they are great ways for me to express gratitude, start on a positive note, and mentally organize my day. My favorite things about the daily are the weekly prompts and the reading section at the beginning. The Diary starts with evidence based research that shows why adding this to your daily routine helps. I loved that it answered a lot of my questions and worries about being able to keep up with the journal and gave me helpful tips for starting new and healthier habits such as journaling. The weekly prompts also help break up the daily routine by fostering reflection. They change week to week which is really nice. I also like the weekly challenges - a great way to add some positivity or new things in your week. I highly recommend this diary. It‚Äôs also a great gift for someone who like journaling or is on a personal journey.",2

"Listerine Total Care Mouthwash, 600 ml",Health Care,nan,1.0,United Kingdom,2020-07-23,"I know the product has got a lot of good reviews which is why I decided to try it. I‚Äôve used Listerine for years but different ones mostly either citrus, original or mild mint. I‚Äôve never had any problems with any of them until now.  My mouth isn‚Äôt usually sensitive to things but I found this far too strong to such an extent it left me with a very sore mouth which even after stopping use is still sore especially y tongue and roof of my mouth.  I‚Äôd suggest if our mouth is the least but sensitive then avoid it.",21
"Listerine Total Care Mouthwash, 600 ml",Health Care,nan,3.0,United Kingdom,2019-12-04,"Although the taste of this mouthwash is great, I feel that it's too strong and harsh. My gums, lips and tongue always feel raw after using this and it often results in skin peeling off my inner lip.

It leaves my teeth clean and breath fresh but the side effects are not worth it. It may be as it has alcohol in it which is contributing to the dry mouth. I don't have a sensitive mouth or teeth so I am attributing this to the mouthwash.

I haven't experienced whitening at all since use.

Personally not for me.",13

"NRS Healthcare M15691 Portable Overbed/Chair Table - Tilting, Adjustable and Wheeled",Health Care,nan,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-05-02,"Im finally organised! Wish I‚Äôd got this 6 weeks ago....

Working from home during Lockdown (office on the bed LOL) it‚Äôs taken me ages setting up / breaking down my kit everyday, but not anymore!

It only took a few minutes to assemble, without needing any tools. The A4 instruction sheet is in large readable text, using step-by-step notes & photos.

One niggle about the instruction sheet - the bars supporting the table top have 2 retractable buttons holding them in place, not one as shown in the photos & notes!

I set up my Surface Pro laptop, an external hard drive, desk fan, reading light AND I still have space on the table top to use my mouse!

Being right-handed, my laptop is on the left hand side of the table, with the fulcrum point (law of physics) furthest away - so you get ‚Äúbounce‚Äù when typing - not enough to be an issue, but when doing long reports or letters, it might make me move the laptop over to the right side / lessen the distance to the down supports = less bounce!

The surface is sealed / wipe clean (not sure why other reviews mention a papery surface?)

The table top is side-edged with a black plastic shielding which doesn‚Äôt sit very ‚Äòproud‚Äô of the surface - maybe 1mm or 2mm - meaning mouse control / typing is still comfortable while resting your arms across the edge.... but the ridge isn‚Äôt high enough to stop items sliding off, especially if you‚Äòre using the table top at a slightly tilted angle - perfect for my use, but might be an issue for people wanting the table top to retain items / stop pens rolling off!

Tilting the top to an angle takes a couple of seconds & fixes firmly in place - again perfect for my use (mouse control / typing / reading)

Still can‚Äôt believe the value for money on this purchase - sturdy, robust, easy to manoeuvre and a large working area!

Absolutely love it!!",12
"NRS Healthcare M15691 Portable Overbed/Chair Table - Tilting, Adjustable and Wheeled",Health Care,nan,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-05-30,Purchased for a member of the family who had a seven weeks stay in hospital and now recovering at home.Excellent purchase which looks similar to the one in the hospital.  Used for meal times and also using for resting books and phone.  The tilting feature has not been used yet so can't comment on that.  Excellent portability and wheels run smoothly from bed to chair.

Top a but slippy so maybe need a job slip mat (I use a tray on top for Mum incase she spills anything (.

He ended up sick again with something else 3-4 weeks ago. The vet couldn‚Äôt figure out what was wrong. I went ahead and bought more of this and it kept him going. He has since passed, but I do recommend this product. It gives them what they need to help when they are sick.

I started to force feed him this. It was a little hard to mix up, and stayed a bit chunky. But other than that. The minute we arrived to my new apartment, we dropped everything off, and rushed him to the vet. It was a very big vet bill, and he had to stay over night. But the vet said that if it weren‚Äôt for this he would have already been dead. I owe it to this company, it saved his life.

I think it's funny that the review asks you to rate the flavor, but the bearded dragon won't answer me when I ask him about that, so I just gave it 5/5. The cat begs for it, so that's a good sign.

Over the past several months, when I start sweating even a little, everything smells. I would walk from my car to work, and get a whiff of myself. After working out or running with friends, I'd be too embarassed to hang around. I could shower before bed, and still need to shower when I get up. I carried extra deo, underwear, and feminine wipes in my purse, gym bag, desk, work backpack. You get the idea. With summer here I was begrudgingly prepared to keep this routine. I'd talked to my gynecologist who had found nothing amiss.

3 days taking these, I noticed a difference, but didn't want to jinx it. 2 weeks in, and I have to say these have changed my life. I don't stink when I sweat, and I don't have to keep a whole bathroom in my purse! No reapplying deo multiple times a day, no multiple showers when I'm not leaving the house! I told my girlfriends all about the probiotics, and they've hopped on the bandwagon. This is totally worth the money.",22

I have struggled with the PH in my body for the last 4 years. I‚Äôve been to various doctors thinking something was wrong. I‚Äôve given up gluten and dairy. I‚Äôve tried low fodmap diets. I‚Äôve quit eating sugar. I‚Äôve done Keto and low carb and I even tried intermittent fasting. Nothing ever seemed to work. I‚Äôve tried a dozen different probiotics and I‚Äôve used digestive enzymes for years. I really wasn‚Äôt optimistic even though I read the reviews and was hopeful. This probiotic is a game changer. I‚Äôm going on day three and I can already start to feel it working. I am so incredibly thankful and am optimistic that foods I have not been able to eat I soon may be able to enjoy again.

Nothing. It‚Äôs totally it active. Not sure how old this is‚Äîbut totally not worth the price. You‚Äôre better off buying this in a store and in person.

I've had a 10 year long battle with depression and I have tried everything under the sun. Most things do not work. I've also tried other probiotics and I have not felt like this ever. This probiotic has put the pep back in my step. I will continue to buy this for years to come. The price is a little steep at $1 a day but think of it as the price of your daily coffee.

First - the product itself is fine but the oversized plastic container that houses the caplets was disgusting. Upon opening the container, it reeked of chemicals. The smell was so pungent that I rehoused the caplets in a spare glass bottle. I decided to go to our local health food store and buy the refrigerated version of this exact brand. Comes in nice glass bottle and it was the same price.

(All my paps were normal my whole life, I was checked out) So I assume that my goofed up cycle was contributing to my long bout of anxiety...and then my anxiety messed up my Ph levels, because I got a BAD and STUBBORN yeast infection. 4 days of diflucan at first, then it came back, or lingered for 2 weeks after. I went to P.Parenthood because, still had a discharge. She looked under the microscope,  YEAST. Miserable. She prescribed me a higher dose of diflucan that I took once every 4 days, instead of each day in a row. That did the trick.However, things still were not of normal smell down there, actually, it was a lack of smell. As if there was no good bacteria. Discharge was dry. I battled this thing for a month and a half. It was SO upsetting which of course made my mental health feel way worse. My husband is usually supportive but he was sick of hearing me complain. I was just done, so I found these. Took for a month straight. WOW. What a game changer. My mood was lifted a little bit, and everything back to normal down there. Yes the diflucan did help, but this is what brought the Ph back to balance. The yeast infection did not come back!Since, I started self hypnotherapy. Not only is my lifelong intermittent anxiety 90% better, but my sex drive is back and my vagina is back to it's dapper self. I FEEL SO MUCH BETTER. Thanks garden of life!",2

I still got a UTI only a few months after starting this and a cranberry supplement which is infuriating considering the cost of this product.  The smell when you open the bottle is TERRIBLE. It smells something like melting plastic. The 2nd bottle of this that I got had the same odor, but it was very faint. The pills are easy to swallow and gave me no other side effects, but I don't think they actually work.The bottle itself is bleh. The top doesn't always stay pressed down, but thankfully I don't have any kids around to get into my pills.I'm going to give them another try and hope that I just had a bad batch before.",1

"NRS Healthcare M15691 Portable Overbed/Chair Table - Tilting, Adjustable and Wheeled",Health Care,24.15,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-05-02,"Im finally organised! Wish I‚Äôd got this 6 weeks ago....

Working from home during Lockdown (office on the bed LOL) it‚Äôs taken me ages setting up / breaking down my kit everyday, but not anymore!

It only took a few minutes to assemble, without needing any tools. The A4 instruction sheet is in large readable text, using step-by-step notes & photos.

One niggle about the instruction sheet - the bars supporting the table top have 2 retractable buttons holding them in place, not one as shown in the photos & notes!

I set up my Surface Pro laptop, an external hard drive, desk fan, reading light AND I still have space on the table top to use my mouse!

Being right-handed, my laptop is on the left hand side of the table, with the fulcrum point (law of physics) furthest away - so you get ‚Äúbounce‚Äù when typing - not enough to be an issue, but when doing long reports or letters, it might make me move the laptop over to the right side / lessen the distance to the down supports = less bounce!

The surface is sealed / wipe clean (not sure why other reviews mention a papery surface?)

The table top is side-edged with a black plastic shielding which doesn‚Äôt sit very ‚Äòproud‚Äô of the surface - maybe 1mm or 2mm - meaning mouse control / typing is still comfortable while resting your arms across the edge.... but the ridge isn‚Äôt high enough to stop items sliding off, especially if you‚Äòre using the table top at a slightly tilted angle - perfect for my use, but might be an issue for people wanting the table top to retain items / stop pens rolling off!

Tilting the top to an angle takes a couple of seconds & fixes firmly in place - again perfect for my use (mouse control / typing / reading)

Still can‚Äôt believe the value for money on this purchase - sturdy, robust, easy to manoeuvre and a large working area!

Absolutely love it!!",12

I needn't have worried.  My funny singing dogs gift voucher arrived on time.  How much on time, I'm not sure because the recipient couldn't find it and nearly ended up deleting it as it had gone into his spam folder.  He thought it was a scam and almost deleted it when he discovered it two days after I'd sent it!  It wasn't until I asked if he'd received it that he told me 'no' and I urged him to check his spam & trash folders, where it was discovered quietly lurking!I received an email as soon as I purchased it saying it had been sent and then another two days later saying it had been received.  Perhaps it only registers as being received once it has been put into the Gift Card section of the recipient's Amazon account.  Anyway, do send it a day or two before the occasion if you want the person to receive it on time because there does seem to be a bit of a longer delay than the fours hours stated in the terms and conditions.I'm definitely going to do this again though as I have another birthday coming up soon and the Covid thing isn't going to go away overnight.

NRS Healthcare Reflect Castellated Memory Foam Cushion - Pressure Care,Health Care,nan,4.0,United Kingdom,2020-02-28,"I tried loads of others sold through Amazon before finally settling on this cushion.

I've now used the Reflect version of this cushion in my office for over 3-years for around 9 hours every weekday.

I'm at the upper end of the suggested weight limit, which is maybe why the cushion has now lost some of its bounce. So, I've just replaced it with a new one. It's an expensive outlay, but working out its cost per year I think its a good investment.

Apart from the reduced support/bounce, the old one has worn really well with no sign of tears or stitching coming apart.",4

The color, soft pink makes it really cute and the daily&weekly sections are very easy to put information in, there's enough space. In the last pages there are some extra empty pages to put notes in which I find very useful. The only downside I can say is that there's only 1 page of stickers, it would've been nice to have some more. But besides this, I really like it!",1

It feels like excellent quality and is definitely a must if you are scatterbrained like me.  The planner came with a book mark and some stickers too, which I love! The one downside for me is I would like if the boxes were a little bigger as I like to plan EVERYTHING! lol but at the same time the ability to write lists down the side is fairly handy and it means that it is more compact so it fits perfectly in my handbag.  I am unsure if it comes in a bigger size but if so I may go for that one next year, either way I will be purchasing again!!All in all I really love this planner and am excited to get to use it throughout the year to help me stay more organised!I would recommend it!:)",6

Makes pumping a much nicer experience. I agree with other reviewers who said it looks funny, and haven‚Äôt had it for long enough to determine whether it loses shape/expands too much (as I‚Äôve seen on one review), but so far I can‚Äôt fault it. It‚Äôs super comfortable to wear, holds everything in place, and does the job! I use it with a Medela Swing Flex pump (single sided). I would definitely recommend getting it if you use anything similar, to free yourself from holding the bottle while pumping (with the medela I can walk around and do stuff now, as the pump‚Äôs motor is a tiny machine that, when battery operated, can be clipped onto the bra).",1

I love my medela pump and I adore their sleep bras so I thought this would be perfect for pumping at work, but the problem arises when you want to take it off but have bottles full of milk attached. The best solution is to un screw the bottles then take off the bra, but I found the flanges leaked the last drops of milk onto me and the whole experience is messy.

The zipper + stretch is a BAD combination and the zipper is nearly impossible to get up.  Once I did get it on though (after a 15 minute struggle) it did work and did fit OK.  Either their sizing chart is wrong or the zipper design is just bad.  May spring for a different brand.",1

A complete game changer for me! The bra keeps my pump in place perfectly as it‚Äôs a nice snug fit. I wear the large and am a 36DD.

So I researched and came across this product.

I have been taking it for about 6 months now.

I won't be seeing my eye specialist for another 6 months, so I will find out then what difference there is in my sight and eye tests by taking these for a year will have made.

However, in the meantime I have definitely noticed a few things:

1. I have had very dry eyes for a few decades now. I have Sjogrens Syndrome. Even eyedrops didn't work well, no matter how many I used, or what make I used. These capsules have improved my dry eyes a lot, to the extent that I can feel the benefit now when I use eyedrops. I still have dry eyes, but they are made comfortable now with eyedrops. Before taking these capsules my eyes were agonisingly dry and stuck together at night and felt like sandpaper rubbing together. But those horrible sensations have now gone. This is after 6 months of taking these capsules.

2. I was having difficulty with driving this time of year when the early morning and later afternoon sun is low in the sky. This sun blinded me. In the end I avoided those times of day this time of year.
Not any more. I was driving into blinding early morning sun, for an important appointment. I was going to go a different route when I suddenly realised I wasn't being blinded by this sun. . It was still very bright with those rays, but I wasn't being blinded by it. I have been out more days with this low sun, and my eyes are fine with it now.

3. Another thing, my night time vision has improved as well. I had stopped driving at night. But I found myself driving back, the other day, in the dark because everything over ran. Then I realised the oncoming headlights were not blinding me any more.

4. I also had found tunnels hard to drive through because I couldn't see well in them. So I would take a very long route to avoid river tunnels. But I found myself driving through a tunnel because I couldn't face the long route that day. Suddenly I realised (it was the same tunnel as previously), that the light didn't seem dim any more. Also in my back garden (I watch the stars in the night sky), I found that I could see in the dark much better.

So with taking these eye capsules for the last 6 months, I have noticed an improvement in the 4 things above.

I will continue to take these capsules always.

If, after research you decide these capsules could help, then I would say give them a go. It has taken me 6 months taking them daily that has got me to this point of improvement.

When I see my eye specialist next, I will come back and report what my eye specialist says. He said that some things would get worse in my eyes, that it was a natural progression. I am hoping that in 6 months time that my eyes will be no worse than when he tested them 6 months ago. That is my hope.

*****

UPDATE August 2021
I said I would come back when I had seen the specialist again. But Covid-19 and lockdowns got in the way, and the eye hospital was not seeing patients.

I continued taking these capsules and recently I saw my hospital eye specialist again (they were seeing patients again). My eyes are continuing to do well. They are not getting worse like the specialist said they would. My specialist is pleased with my progress.

I am very pleased with these capsules.

Also because of Covid-19 and the lockdown, the NHS retinopathy team in Wales were not monitoring patients. I should have had their eye checks because of my diabetes but they were not doing them. However, recently, just before my hospital eye appointment my opticians offered a similar test to check my eyes. I decided to pay for it. My optician showed me the results, and he said to carry on whatever I was doing because it was working for my eyes. My eyes were improved and I had stopped the natural progression my hospital specialist said was inevitable.

I shall continue with these capsules.

Thank you

The Hairbrush is nice and gentle but a bit Plasticky, the nail cutters are ok but we found that they weren‚Äôt sharp enough and actually bought a small high quality pair which is way more effective, the nose sucker is way too big for a newborn and not that great later on (we ended up buying the Braun electric one after trying various other solutions). The comb is just a comb. We haven‚Äôt used the scissors. The only thing of any use is the thermometer, you can just buy one from a pharmacy as save the money and in end we ended up getting a forehead one when our daughter was 9 months because she wouldn‚Äôt stay still long enough to check her under the arm.

The brush and comb set are food quality bristles are nice and soft. The only thing I didn't like from the kit was the nasal aspirator there is hardly any suction on there and did not clean her nose at all couldn't pull anything out.

The opening of the nasal aspirator is definitely too big for a newborn, it was even too big for our baby when he had a cold when he was three months old. The nail clipper is too sharp, but I find the scissors are great. I used the brush a few times, but never the comb (though maybe you will if your baby has lots of hair).

"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",Health Care,nan,1.0,United Kingdom,2019-12-18,"Awful quality, there's nothing in this set that can actually be used. I had to buy every single item separately. I'll give you a few reasons for not buying this product. 1. The nail clip blade is extremely sharp and presents some irregularities. I've tried to cut my newborn nails and just by touching it cut my baby's skin, haven't even pressed on it. Checking it on with my finger I have realised it's too sharp. 2. Baby brush and comb... seriously? Those are not suitable for delicate baby skin, the bristles are too strong. 3. Digital thermometer - that should be posed under baby's arm or mouth to give the temperature... that's a joke. First of all, baby is wriggling too much and it's impossible to keep the thermometer in position under arm for around 1 minute. Secondly, you can't make the baby keep the mouth shut for a better temperature measurement... otherwise, I've tested on my own mouth and was giving a result of 34deg Celsius which is impossible. 4. Nose cleaner - there are better products out there that can actually do the job. 5. Nail file - single use. 6. Teeth brush for newborn and baby? The brush has plastic bristles which are not suitable for baby that can chew and swallow. Unfortunately, I cannot return it as I bought this product long time in advance before the baby was born. But please make yourself a favour and avoid buying this.",0
"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",Health Care,nan,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-02-28,"Great little kit, especially when you have a newborn with a cold. I love the small Emery boards to help keep those sharp little nails down. The only thing that I find fiddly is the thermometer which you have to hold in place for quite some time to get an accurate reading.",0
"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",Health Care,nan,1.0,United Kingdom,2020-03-12,The most important item in this kit is the thermometer. My baby is poorly and I went to take his temperature and the thermometer is dead. The first time I come to use it and the battery dies. Really unacceptable given that I need to take his temperature in an emergency.,0
"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",Health Care,nan,1.0,United Kingdom,2020-05-08,"Honestly just cheap and useless tat made solely to feel like a worried mum and dad to be are prepared. When push comes to shove and you need it with a newborn, this stuff is useless. There is place in hell reserved for whoever thought the thermometer would work for a wriggly newborn. Cheap tat. Avoid.",0
"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",Health Care,nan,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-05-22,Bought to get the thermometer as they were very difficult to get hold of at the time. Gave the rest to a friend who was expecting. She was very pleased.,0

"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",Health Care,nan,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-06-27,"A great thing to have in the drawer for your newborn. It‚Äôs has everything you need any more to get you started.

I‚Äôm not thrilled with the thermometer, although it does get the job done. I think I will spend more on a better one in the future (more than what the whole kit costs).

The brush leaves my daughters hair lovely and the nail clippers work a treat.",0
"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",Health Care,nan,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-05-30,Perfect little health care pack for your baby. Everything is easy to use and I find it most useful. The nail clippers are great and the little hair brush is excellent for cradle cap. We haven't used many of the other items yet but I'm sure we will. It's a great kit.,0
"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",Health Care,nan,3.0,United Kingdom,2020-01-11,"This pack is just as every other pack like this you can find. Yes it‚Äôs practical, but he brush is not very soft, and the items are not great quality. If it‚Äôs all you can afford yes it does the job but I do advise in buying the items separated instead . My thermometer does not seem very accurate either.",0
"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",Health Care,nan,3.0,United Kingdom,2020-02-12,"It's a set, yes handy to keep all the goods in one place, but my disappointment is with the fact hat some of the items don't really work.... Thermometer is bad, not showing correctly, the nose pump is too big for a baby nostrils. I wouldn't buy 5his again",0
"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",Health Care,nan,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-06-26,I bought this for my child. It was easy to use. The delivery was quick and the price was reasonable. Also the communications from seller were quick. Very convenient to use during travelling.,0
"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",Health Care,nan,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-05-12,"Has everything you need for baby, although I mainly use the thermometer/files/clippers...baby doesn‚Äôt have any hair so we don‚Äôt use the brush yet..I let baby suck/chew on the toothbrush as he‚Äôs only 4 months but he likes it on his gums.

"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",Health Care,nan,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-06-20,"It actually is good. When I first saw the scissors, I decided that they are complete useless and didn't even attempt to use them. Then 4 months later decided to try them out and realised that they actually are great for baby nails.",0
"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",Health Care,nan,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-05-11,"Every thing you would need for a baby all in one place, not sur about the suction pump as it looks really big for a new born child.",0
"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",Health Care,nan,2.0,United Kingdom,2020-07-01,"Quality is okay I only use the scissors for my new born baby which I love , I tried to use the nose sucker but I feel that the thing is too big nor a newborn baby nose so I couldn't use it , the brush I feel that is not soft enough maybe for an older baby is better .",0
"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",Health Care,nan,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-01-14,"Haven‚Äôt used yet as baby due in June,  but all items are good quilts and the case is strong and will keep them together which is a good idea",0
"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",Health Care,nan,3.0,United Kingdom,2020-01-09,"Expensive for what it is and the thermometer takes so long to read it is pointless, unless your baby never moves you will not be able to get their temperature.",0
"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",Health Care,nan,3.0,United Kingdom,2019-12-06,This kit is okay...its meant for an older kid. The brush is not very soft for a new born and basal aspirator is too large for baby even at 4 months.,0

I mostly use the nail clipper, comb, brush and emergy board. The thermometer is okay but I prefer the thermometer which goes in the ear as I think that gives the best results and I have noticed many doctors using thermometers that go in the ear as well. The Nasal Aspirator is way too big especially to use on a baby that is under 2 months. And the toothbrush is not soft at all. I think its better to buy individual products rather than the whole set.

Two courses of antibiotics didn‚Äôt help at all. I‚Äôd post some before and after pics but nobody wants to see that. Pretty horrific 4 inch open wound.

This stuff is easy to apply and doesn‚Äôt distress her at all. Looks to be doing exactly what it promises - kill bacteria and promote healing without pain. Will keep an emergency supply.

Not even 6 hours after the grass being cut they had both started to scratch and chew their paws.

I have tried many many creams and spray over the years, including various (expensive) treatments from the vet and even the use of steroids for one of them as she had got so bad she was going bald with all her itching!

My male had managed to scratch a horrible sore onto his stomach area, I had tried treating it with another well- known dog anti itch brand for several days with no luck what so ever and figured it was going to have to be another vet trip before the cut turned into a full-blown wound and would get infected. I had seen this spray advertised several times but to be honest, I just assumed it would be the same as all the others I already have sitting in the cupboard which didn't work for us. However, when telling a friend I was going to have to take him back to the vet she recommended trying Leucillin Antiseptic Skin Care Spray and told me her vet uses it and that she had had great results too so decided it was worth a go.

Item arrived really quickly and spraying it onto the cut didn't seem to bother him at all. Within a day the sore had already started to look better. Even better my dog was no longer scratching at the area or trying to constantly lick it. Have used the spray for 3 days (twice a day although it does recommend 3 times) and today the area has completely healed and no longer red or sore. My other Maltese hasn't been as bad (so far) this year however she has been chewing at her paws a bit. I have given her feet a quick spray once a day and that alone seems to be enough to stop her biting and causing more harm.

Am truly amazed by how well it has worked, although have to say I'm a little annoyed I didn't purchase it sooner as I would have saved the dogs many summers of itching misery and myself many large vet bills!",3

"The 6-Minute Diary Pure | Gratitude Journal, Mindfulness Journal for Men & Women | 6 Minutes a Day for more Mental Health, Happiness & Self Care",Health Care,nan,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-01-29,"I bought this to go with a couple of books for my children (the 5 minute diary for the eldest and the 3 minute one for the younger child)... My initial objective was to get them to be grateful for their dinner... even if it's NOT chicken nuggets... be grateful you have food, you have warmth, you have comfort, even if the dinner had REAL chicken in it, as well as mushrooms!!! ... and that seemed to work, we got over that, not entirely of course, but a lesson has been learned (somewhat) in that department...
The unexpected by product of this experience however, is that THIS book grabbed my attention... it's not 'just' a gratitude journal which you write stuff down, it's the preamble, it's the all the information up front - the bit about why you're doing it in the first place...
That's what hooked me...
And then practicing the ritual with my daughters each day.
And at first, it was clutching at the obvious; grateful for food, water, clothes, warmth
But then something started to change, unexpectedly so... I started to dig deeper and feel more positive...
My gratitude now involves; realising my self worth and what I mean to my children, recognising what we have, not what we don't, grateful for opportunities and more meaningful, deeper reflection when it comes to positive affirmations....and one of my good deeds today, was simply 'Acceptance'... and 'Acceptance with grace'...
I love this book.
I have recommended and even bought copies for friends and colleagues...
I am more positive, more energised, more determined and dare I say happier in myself... I didn't even realise I needed changing, my days had been focused on other people and things and work and jobs which needed doing, that I forgot myself along the way. But I'm back now... and it feels great :)",13
"The 6-Minute Diary Pure | Gratitude Journal, Mindfulness Journal for Men & Women | 6 Minutes a Day for more Mental Health, Happiness & Self Care",Health Care,nan,5.0,United Kingdom,2019-12-26,"I absolutely love this product.  I started with the Six Minute Diary but was rather half-hearted about it - thinking it couldn't possibly be just six minutes a day... but it arrived and I filled it in that day ... and the next day... and the next day...I loved the daily quotes/affirmations;  I loved the fact that the statements/questions are simple and straightforward and didn't make it feel like an exam or that there was a ""wrong answer"".  I just love it.So much that as I filled it in one day.. then the next... then the next... I came to the end of it.  I was delighted and disappointed all at the same time... so I immediately ordered the Six Minute Diary Plus... and am very much looking to not only continuing my morning and evening ""journalling"" (which has improved my focus on my life, my goals, what I will accept and what is unacceptable to me) and I have high hopes that ""Plus"" will allow me to continue to start and end each day in a positive, productive, pro-active mindset - which has had a massive beneficial impact on so many other aspects of my life.I'm going to end here because I know I'm beginning to sound evangelical about it... but I really can't recommend it highly enough.  Buy it and tell yourself ""I'll give it my best shot for a week""... don't look at the whole book and think I'll never get to the end... just tell yourself ""seven days"".  That's what I did... but the first seven days were followed by the second seven days.. then the third ... and the fourth... and ... on those days where I couldn't fill it in first thing (with a cup of coffee in bed) ... I missed it.  My day didn't ""start right""... and on those rare occasions where I couldn't end my day positively reflecting on all the good things that had happened... I went to sleep with my heart that little bit less content .. and I couldn't hear my soul singing the lullaby that the diary created every evening.Buy it.  Try it.  I hope, like me, you'll love it.",4

I have found it to an invaluable aid to dealing with the current stresses and uncertainties we all find ourselves in.

"The 6-Minute Diary Pure | Gratitude Journal, Mindfulness Journal for Men & Women | 6 Minutes a Day for more Mental Health, Happiness & Self Care",Health Care,nan,4.0,United Kingdom,2020-04-25,"I got a lot out of the first volume of The 6-Minute Diary.  It helped me, a natural pessimist, to take stock of and appreciate the good things in life just by asking me a few simple (and yes, repetitive) questions every single day, with a weekly set of deeper questions that ultimately helped me think about what was important in life to me.  This second volume is useful for keeping that positivity and gratitude going. I gave it only 4 stars because the weekly reflection, which I used to find sometimes challenging but definitely enlightening, has been replaced by a 'lighter' version, although I can see that it is still useful. Overall I have found that creating the habit of thinking about the positives in life, however small, has been really beneficial for me.",0

Well, this was probably my best purchase for sanitising my hands. This gel is antiseptic and given it is used before conducting surgery and minor operations, I think it's effectiveness is unquestionable.

I am very thorough when washing my hands and usually rub the gel into my hands for around 3 minutes, with close attention to all areas and under the nails. However, the peace of mind afterwards is fantastic, as even though I take a sanitizer with me too, you feel ""bulletproof"" knowing this product has a residual effect for up to 6 hours!

"Hibiscrub Health Care, 500ml",Health Care,7.50,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-03-21,Item arrived promptly.  I have used it once so far to help problems with my dog's skin.  It was easy enough to use although came out of the container very quickly so be careful not to spill.  It does not lather up much.  I will report results on dogs skin when it has time to workUpdate:  the greasy skin and patches of hair loss have almost completely disappeared.  Occasionally a small patch will appear but goes away quickly with treatment of the area.,1
"Hibiscrub Health Care, 500ml",Health Care,7.50,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-04-20,"HiBiScrub is the one clinical product that I always try to have i the house, although getting it (especially now) isn't as easy as it was. I started using it after multiple hospital visits some years ago and haven't stopped, keeping a bottle around for anything from treating skin problems to general hand washing. If I could find fault, it's that this 500ml bottle doesn't come with a dispenser top, so you'll most likely need to pour it into a more handy bottle, but the smaller versions come with pour tops so get one of those and then one of these once the smaller is finished.",0

I have a cat who gets into fights and also has an acne problem.  Used this recently on his chin area and it is clearing up nicely.

"Hibiscrub Health Care, 500ml",Health Care,7.50,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-06-29,First used for 5  days prior to hip replacement and continued to use diluted daily in shower mixed with a hydrating shower gel which makes it go a long way and stops the skin from drying out.Benefits are numerous as seen in other reviews. The antibacterial effects last around six hours according to product info. Eliminates bo after work outs and while family members who do not use have been beset by winter colds I have not sucumbed  which has never happened previously. However it states it is not anti viral but if it helps resist tramsmitable bacterial infection it's a no brainer.,1

"Lictin Baby Health Care Kit - Baby Grooming Kit Newborn Baby Care Accessories, 15PCS Safety Cutter Nail Care Set",Health Care,14.99,3.0,United Kingdom,2020-07-17,Bought it instead of the Tommy tippee one as this has more things that may be of use. Haven't used all the items but the nail cutter is fab! The soft brush however has completely lost its shape and squished up when it was squashed in the box with the other items,4

"Wright's Traditional Coal Tar Soap 002629, 500 gram, Pack of 4",Health Care,4.24,4.0,United Kingdom,2020-04-20,"I procured a pack of these heading into the CV19 era as a backup, thinking that there would come a time when, bereft of all liquid soap, all fragrant latherings, we would be forced to turn native, to return to the scent of coal tar soap....

I had to turn to it sooner than I ever expected..... The increased washing with the Blue scented liquid soap did no favours to my delicate digits. Dryness and itchiness setting in irrespective of how much Scandinavian hand cream I applied twixt scrubbing.

I started on the Wright's and immediately knew the Right choice had been made...

I was catapulted back to childhood days....that smell...it lingers....and I remember

No more dryness, no more itchy prickly pinkies....just a dab of hand cream and life is good...

However......the department of infernal affairs, (she who must be listened to..)..despises the smell....but I've been allowed to keep my bar of Wright's in a sealed box, by the sink. ...for now...

"Wright's Traditional Coal Tar Soap 002629, 500 gram, Pack of 4",Health Care,4.24,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-06-19,Bought this for the bathroom to try out. Lathers very well and the smell takes you back if you‚Äôre of a certain age. It‚Äôs pretty strong so if you‚Äôre not keen then keep it in a sealed bag. Personally I don‚Äôt mind the smell and it stops my hands from being too dry due to using harsh soap. Not for vegans though. It contains animal ingredients but sadly no longer has coal tar in it.,1

Monster munch feet, horrible yellow toenails... I know right? Absolutely horrible vision for you all, so I have tried everything, tablets nope, creams nope, everything! but then a vet friend said hey, try this product which is mainly used for animals. I laughed, then had more wine and thought ahhh... Go on, and my goodness what a brilliant product! If your toenails are yellow, brittle... One could say like a horse hoof.... Then, this product is for you. Also just want to say that woman who uploaded pictures of the worst case scenario complications of this product is being completely silly, I mean it's exactly the same principle when you take any medication, they say 1 in 10,000 MIGHT suffer a reaction so pffttt. I've not started barking yet so I'm pretty sure it's safe AND I have healthy nails... *neigh*",42

The hibiclens was amazing, after one day of using it i saw the biggest results, the stubborn spots on my face was shrinking and my pores were smaller than ever. BUT make sure you‚Äôre not using this everyday. Use it at night every 2 days as it could make your face more sensitive and it can worsen your face but if used the right way it could make you look amazing!",8

"Hibiscrub Health Care, 500ml",Health Care,7.50,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-03-26,"Thankfully, I thought about this product as soon as the virus that we all want to be eradicated raised its head. Well, this was probably my best purchase for sanitising my hands. This gel is antiseptic and given it is used before conducting surgery and minor operations, I think it's effectiveness is unquestionable.

I am very thorough when washing my hands and usually rub the gel into my hands for around 3 minutes, with close attention to all areas and under the nails. However, the peace of mind afterwards is fantastic, as even though I take a sanitizer with me too, you feel ""bulletproof"" knowing this product has a residual effect for up to 6 hours!

The smell is pleasant and I have not had any allergic reaction despite having sensitive skin. However, this handwash is not cheap but you get what you pay for, so the peace of mind is worth every penny!!!",4

"Hibiscrub Health Care, 500ml",Health Care,7.50,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-07-16,I read quite a few reviews on different sites about Hibiscrub and decided to buy.  I have a cat who gets into fights and also has an acne problem.  Used this recently on his chin area and it is clearing up nicely.  Lovely clean smell and I used it on my hands after gardening and I have sensitive skin and it didn't cause any skin reaction.  Will always have this in the house.,1

It was easy enough to use although came out of the container very quickly so be careful not to spill.  It does not lather up much.  I will report results on dogs skin when it has time to workUpdate:  the greasy skin and patches of hair loss have almost completely disappeared.  Occasionally a small patch will appear but goes away quickly with treatment of the area.,1

I started using it after multiple hospital visits some years ago and haven't stopped, keeping a bottle around for anything from treating skin problems to general hand washing. If I could find fault, it's that this 500ml bottle doesn't come with a dispenser top, so you'll most likely need to pour it into a more handy bottle, but the smaller versions come with pour tops so get one of those and then one of these once the smaller is finished.",0

"Hibiscrub Health Care, 500ml",Health Care,7.50,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-06-29,First used for 5  days prior to hip replacement and continued to use diluted daily in shower mixed with a hydrating shower gel which makes it go a long way and stops the skin from drying out.Benefits are numerous as seen in other reviews. The antibacterial effects last around six hours according to product info. Eliminates bo after work outs and while family members who do not use have been beset by winter colds I have not sucumbed  which has never happened previously. However it states it is not anti viral but if it helps resist tramsmitable bacterial infection it's a no brainer.,1

I've done that once a day for the last four days, and now my skin is practically entirely good as new, with no odour whatsoever, even after a long day of walking.I wasn't sure how effective this would be, but it has definitely surpassed any expectations I had.

Wash feet using this just like soap every day for a week, then just use every few days. Stinky feet cured after a couple of days. Magic.

"Listerine Total Care Mouthwash, 600 ml",Health Care,nan,1.0,United Kingdom,2020-07-23,"I know the product has got a lot of good reviews which is why I decided to try it. I‚Äôve used Listerine for years but different ones mostly either citrus, original or mild mint. I‚Äôve never had any problems with any of them until now.  My mouth isn‚Äôt usually sensitive to things but I found this far too strong to such an extent it left me with a very sore mouth which even after stopping use is still sore especially y tongue and roof of my mouth.  I‚Äôd suggest if our mouth is the least but sensitive then avoid it.",21
"Listerine Total Care Mouthwash, 600 ml",Health Care,nan,3.0,United Kingdom,2019-12-04,"Although the taste of this mouthwash is great, I feel that it's too strong and harsh. My gums, lips and tongue always feel raw after using this and it often results in skin peeling off my inner lip.

It leaves my teeth clean and breath fresh but the side effects are not worth it. It may be as it has alcohol in it which is contributing to the dry mouth. I don't have a sensitive mouth or teeth so I am attributing this to the mouthwash.

I haven't experienced whitening at all since use.

Personally not for me.",13

"Wright's Traditional Coal Tar Soap 002629, 500 gram, Pack of 4",Health Care,4.24,4.0,United Kingdom,2020-04-20,"I procured a pack of these heading into the CV19 era as a backup, thinking that there would come a time when, bereft of all liquid soap, all fragrant latherings, we would be forced to turn native, to return to the scent of coal tar soap....

I had to turn to it sooner than I ever expected..... The increased washing with the Blue scented liquid soap did no favours to my delicate digits. Dryness and itchiness setting in irrespective of how much Scandinavian hand cream I applied twixt scrubbing.

I started on the Wright's and immediately knew the Right choice had been made...

I was catapulted back to childhood days....that smell...it lingers....and I remember

No more dryness, no more itchy prickly pinkies....just a dab of hand cream and life is good...

However......the department of infernal affairs, (she who must be listened to..)..despises the smell....but I've been allowed to keep my bar of Wright's in a sealed box, by the sink. ...for now...

"Leucillin Natural Antiseptic Spray | Antibacterial, Antifungal & Antiviral | for Dogs, Cats and All Animals | for Itchy Skin and All Skin Care Health | 500ml",Health Care,nan,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-06-24,I purchased this to treat a type of itchy eczema on the back of my head which was inside my hairline. I have long hair and creams were difficult to apply and made a mess. I apply after washing my hair and leave to dry; it keeps the eczema under control. The eczema does come back as per a lot of eczema but it always quickly clears it. I've used it recently on a weird itchy rash on the back of my hand and it took the nasty redness and heat out of it overnight.Currently treating my husband's conjunctivitis with it and it appears to be working on that as well.I realise we sound like a right pair üòÜWe do use it on the pets and it helps wounds heal quickly. Completely cures hotspots on my friend's labradoodle in just 24 hours. Magic stuff!,17

High recommend",10

I noticed two days ago my horse had a runny eyes due to the flies and she is prone to get conjunctivitis (last year the cream the vet gave me for this was very expensive). So I sprayed this a few times in her eyes and by the next day the running had stopped and the eye was clear again. It really doesn't sting your eyes (my mare didn't mind it one bit)  - I have used it in my own eyes as it is safe for humans too. My partner got an insect bite today which really stung but as soon as he sprayed this on it the itchiness disappeared and it has almost cleared up now (a few hours later). My friend's horse had a horse fly bite yesterday and I brought out this trusty purple spray - the area is fine now and there is no swelling. I also use it also on my gelding's feathers to ward off feather mites and summer itching. It has really helped and there is very little foot stomping now. So I highly recommend this very versatile and effective spray that will benefit you in so many ways :),3

It was really bad but the spray did help! Now however she is averse to spray bottles so thought she was being reprimanded and purposefully irritated so she became rather depressed. Also after using this on my blisters IT STUNG LIKE HELL! so I don't know maybe it actually hurts alot! And Though her skin infection healed she would still lick at it before it could fully recover. I then switched to HomeoPet Hotspot medicine and put it in her meals for two months straight and the skin and fur returned and she's been well ever since. The spray works well and is good for human and pet emergencies but becareful if your pet might be afraid. Also after she was depressed a Kong kickaroo and thrive cat treats cheered her up!,1

I find that there is very little or no 'scent', or if there was it didn't last very long at all. It does not take a lot of spray to enable you to cover both hands, and dries very quickly.

Bought it on basis of so many positive reviews cross-referenced with several scholarly articles. It is a chemical that our own cells produce in the immune reaction, although obviously in tiny volumes, and was used in WW1 on wards. Problem has been producing it in a stable form, it used to have to be generated on-site, but recent advances have come up with solutions with shelf-lives of a year or so.In anti SARS-CoV-2 sense we use it for misting items we‚Äôve brought back from the shops, for disinfecting surfaces, spraying down our outside gear etc. But we‚Äôve also found it seems to have given our cockatiel some relief from self-plucking of his shoulder feathers. Just like all the dog and cat-owners have said he doesn‚Äôt flinch or seem to experience any discomfort whatsoever and just seems to be calmer and more comfortable. We sprayed it on ourselves first to test, no sting, just a slight tang of swimming pool. Great product.",3

Before I decided to purchase the Go Girl planner, I went to YouTube to see what it was all about. I really like the simplicity of it but also the fact that you can log your goals, mind map etc. The planner also allows you to add colour and decorate.  Due to the current situation we are in, I found that I didn‚Äôt need so much space as I have been using in my current planner so I decided to order the GG planner and start in April. I don‚Äôt mind it being undated now and I like that it is so compact (comes in A5 as well) and the layout for the weekly spread is good. Overall, a really nice planner!",1

If you use a Sharpie you get bleed through on the pages. So I glued some together with Prit-type-stick but they came open again. The closing elastic dislodged upon opening & Gorilla glue didn't work to secure it back in place...urgh.I think these planners are good for replacing an annual diary with the habbit trackers etc but you can't fit much on the pages as it's smaller than A5.  I don't think bullet journals are for me personally as the dots make me a bit dizzy. I thought I'd give it a go though to make more feel more organised but after 2 months I've found I'm writing more in my annual diary & on my iphone notes. Have skipped most of February already.  I've come back to it but prefer my week - to - view diary. I think this has taught me a valuable lesson though to go back to a day - to - view- dairy next year.",6

It's not too big or too small.The only thing bad about it, which tbh is more bad about me lol, is room for human error, I wanted the A5 and not the smaller version, the A5 seems to be only undated in rose gold, and if you're like me and prone to making mistakes, you spend time filling in the days and dates and then get them wrong and having to make ugly scribbles to correct them and not want to use it anymore",5

The fact it isn‚Äôt bulky is perfect. The only things that you need to consider are it takes ages to write all the dates in and the calendar starts on Sunday and the diary part on Monday.

In my case, I never did.I wanted something to simply log some simple workouts and food details but found this diary so cram packed I completely lost motivation to even start and ended up buying another much simpler work out / nutrition diary.

Undated ‚Äì Start Anytime, Lasts 1 Year ‚Äì Rose Gold",Health Care,12.99,5.0,United States,2020-07-02,"I received this planner yesterday and was so eager to try it out, I opened it immediately! The color was great, it had 3 different color page placers, a spot to hold your pen, a little pocket in the very back that had stickers, in the front it has several pages for you to write down your goals and on each month page it has spots so that you can update your goals and the quality seemed pretty great.
Unfortunately this specific planner is not going to work for me. The dates had to be filled in by hand which isn't horrible except for the months where there are '6' weeks so to speak. There are only 5 weeks worth of blocks so some months didn't fit all the way. For me personally, I want my full months available instead of having to flip the page for the remainder of the month.
Also, I did not realize it, but there was no additional pages for ""notes"". Instead it has dotted pages in the back. For some that may be great but for me, I will not use it and prefer to have the note pages.
The last thing that I found wouldn't work for me was the size. This was a fail on my part as the listing gives you the dimensions of the planner, however, I didnt realize that the spaces to write in would be as small as they were. Again, that was a judgment fail on my part since this is a tablet sized planner. After having this is realized that I need a full (bigger) size option.
Before even receiving the planner I received a message from the seller thanking me for my purchase and stating that they have a 60 day money back guarantee if you dont absolutely love it and to please reach out with any issues. So I reached out and expressed my minor issues. I received a response very quickly offering a replacement (one that has the dates already filled in) or a full no hassle refund. Unfortunately I declined the replacement since it was only able to correct 1 of the 3 flaws. They issued a refund immediately after my decline and even told me not to worry about returning the original. The customer service with this company was phenomenal!!! Even though it did not work for me, I still give this product 5 stars.",0

We bought it during quarantine so in a time when organizing your life to keep you sane is crucial it keeps her busy and focused for each day week and month and motivates her to set and follow through on her goals. A very encouraging planner the way it‚Äôs designed and small enough to keep it close by or throw it in her purse and it‚Äôs not bulky. Pages are sturdy so no accidental page rips. Love the stickers for colors to catch your eye. But something anyone for any age can use.

There is more room in the sections for each week, though. If you have large handwriting this planner will NOT work for you unless you want to practice writing smaller, much smaller or even use abbreviations. The pages are very thick and sturdy which is great and you can get creative using washi tape or colored markers because the pages are white with dark gray font. Overall, I'm happy with it but might try a bigger planner next time , which I probably wont like carrying in my purse, so I'll try to be neat and write smaller.",0

I love that it is blank and yet has some structure for me to build in. The planner lets you create your own input (not predetermined by a bunch of labeled areas) but also gives format that supports planning for months, weeks, and long-term goals. I have adapted this planner to my needs. It's awesome that it has a weekly view so I can see all my to-dos and my plans in one glance. The only caveat I would say to buyers here is be sure to click the size you want - I accidentally clicked the smaller size and had to re-order later. I like the larger option so I can fit more in. The larger one is still small enough to be easy to carry and fit in my purse. Totally recommend this planner.",0

I have tried bullet journal style planning for a couple of years now, and I always fall behind because it takes a lot of time to draw out the pages for the upcoming week. I love how this planner has a monthly and a weekly spread, but they are blank so you can fill in the dates yourself (which is really helpful to me because there are some weeks I just don't think to plan, and I don't feel like I am wasting any paper since I can just use the next page, even if it's a couple weeks down the road.) I am happy that the second page of each week has a few helpful trackers, for the week's priorities, a to-do list, and a habit tracker, and below that, it has BULLET JOURNAL space on the lower half of the page. So I can put my own things down. At the back, there are quite a few pages of bullet journal space as well, so I have a perfect mix of being able to do big things in the BuJo pages, but not have to draw out a schedule from scratch each week. I also love that there are THREE bookmarks attached so you can keep one in each section of the planner.I will say, the one thing that I wish is that there were a couple different options to choose from with the layout of the weekly spread. I would personally like the dates to go across the top of the two page spread, rather on the first page, and then have the trackers and BuJo space underneath, also going across both pages.",1

Pros:
Customize it in every way
Fun colors
Pen holder is great
Separates months and weeks in different section
Ample space for each day
You can use stickers or inspirational things to make it fun
Habit tracker is GREAT
Helps maintain goals
Thick paper

Cons:
There are too many placeholder ribbons
A bit pricey
The months and weeks are separate rather than there being a month followed by weeks, another month followed by weeks...it creates a bit of flipping back and forth",0

It is small so if you can't write small maybe this isn't the best option for you. There is a bigger option for more money but the small size is fine for me.

He licks at his feet incessantly which makes them worse (and is extremely irritating for us!). We have tried apoquel and steroids from the Vet on and off for years, which does help after about a week. I ordered this product and it was delivered the next day. I used it that night and the next day his feet were around 80% better! I was shocked and absolutely amazed. We've been spraying his feet three times a day for three days now and this is the best his feet have looked for years. I would absolutely recommend this product.",32

Two courses of antibiotics didn‚Äôt help at all. I‚Äôd post some before and after pics but nobody wants to see that. Pretty horrific 4 inch open wound. Bought this in desperation and, within 3 days, the wound was clearing up beautifully. With the aid of a lampshade collar, and 3 good doses of this a day, plus some gentle cleaning with cotton wool pads I realise I could have cared for her perfectly well myself for about ¬£20. This stuff is easy to apply and doesn‚Äôt distress her at all. Looks to be doing exactly what it promises - kill bacteria and promote healing without pain. Will keep an emergency supply. For a tenner, it‚Äôs worth having on standby for any pet owner. Some comments about short shelf-life but mine came with 14 months until expiry.",41

Not even 6 hours after the grass being cut they had both started to scratch and chew their paws.

I have tried many many creams and spray over the years, including various (expensive) treatments from the vet and even the use of steroids for one of them as she had got so bad she was going bald with all her itching!

My male had managed to scratch a horrible sore onto his stomach area, I had tried treating it with another well- known dog anti itch brand for several days with no luck what so ever and figured it was going to have to be another vet trip before the cut turned into a full-blown wound and would get infected. I had seen this spray advertised several times but to be honest, I just assumed it would be the same as all the others I already have sitting in the cupboard which didn't work for us. However, when telling a friend I was going to have to take him back to the vet she recommended trying Leucillin Antiseptic Skin Care Spray and told me her vet uses it and that she had had great results too so decided it was worth a go.

Item arrived really quickly and spraying it onto the cut didn't seem to bother him at all. Within a day the sore had already started to look better. Even better my dog was no longer scratching at the area or trying to constantly lick it. Have used the spray for 3 days (twice a day although it does recommend 3 times) and today the area has completely healed and no longer red or sore. My other Maltese hasn't been as bad (so far) this year however she has been chewing at her paws a bit. I have given her feet a quick spray once a day and that alone seems to be enough to stop her biting and causing more harm.

Am truly amazed by how well it has worked, although have to say I'm a little annoyed I didn't purchase it sooner as I would have saved the dogs many summers of itching misery and myself many large vet bills!",3

"The 6-Minute Diary Pure | Gratitude Journal, Mindfulness Journal for Men & Women | 6 Minutes a Day for more Mental Health, Happiness & Self Care",Health Care,nan,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-01-29,"I bought this to go with a couple of books for my children (the 5 minute diary for the eldest and the 3 minute one for the younger child)... My initial objective was to get them to be grateful for their dinner... even if it's NOT chicken nuggets... be grateful you have food, you have warmth, you have comfort, even if the dinner had REAL chicken in it, as well as mushrooms!!! ... and that seemed to work, we got over that, not entirely of course, but a lesson has been learned (somewhat) in that department...
The unexpected by product of this experience however, is that THIS book grabbed my attention... it's not 'just' a gratitude journal which you write stuff down, it's the preamble, it's the all the information up front - the bit about why you're doing it in the first place...
That's what hooked me...
And then practicing the ritual with my daughters each day.
And at first, it was clutching at the obvious; grateful for food, water, clothes, warmth
But then something started to change, unexpectedly so... I started to dig deeper and feel more positive...
My gratitude now involves; realising my self worth and what I mean to my children, recognising what we have, not what we don't, grateful for opportunities and more meaningful, deeper reflection when it comes to positive affirmations....and one of my good deeds today, was simply 'Acceptance'... and 'Acceptance with grace'...
I love this book.
I have recommended and even bought copies for friends and colleagues...
I am more positive, more energised, more determined and dare I say happier in myself... I didn't even realise I needed changing, my days had been focused on other people and things and work and jobs which needed doing, that I forgot myself along the way. But I'm back now... and it feels great :)",13
"The 6-Minute Diary Pure | Gratitude Journal, Mindfulness Journal for Men & Women | 6 Minutes a Day for more Mental Health, Happiness & Self Care",Health Care,nan,5.0,United Kingdom,2019-12-26,"I absolutely love this product.  I started with the Six Minute Diary but was rather half-hearted about it - thinking it couldn't possibly be just six minutes a day... but it arrived and I filled it in that day ... and the next day... and the next day...I loved the daily quotes/affirmations;  I loved the fact that the statements/questions are simple and straightforward and didn't make it feel like an exam or that there was a ""wrong answer"".  I just love it.So much that as I filled it in one day.. then the next... then the next... I came to the end of it.  I was delighted and disappointed all at the same time... so I immediately ordered the Six Minute Diary Plus... and am very much looking to not only continuing my morning and evening ""journalling"" (which has improved my focus on my life, my goals, what I will accept and what is unacceptable to me) and I have high hopes that ""Plus"" will allow me to continue to start and end each day in a positive, productive, pro-active mindset - which has had a massive beneficial impact on so many other aspects of my life.I'm going to end here because I know I'm beginning to sound evangelical about it... but I really can't recommend it highly enough.  Buy it and tell yourself ""I'll give it my best shot for a week""... don't look at the whole book and think I'll never get to the end... just tell yourself ""seven days"".  That's what I did... but the first seven days were followed by the second seven days.. then the third ... and the fourth... and ... on those days where I couldn't fill it in first thing (with a cup of coffee in bed) ... I missed it.  My day didn't ""start right""... and on those rare occasions where I couldn't end my day positively reflecting on all the good things that had happened... I went to sleep with my heart that little bit less content .. and I couldn't hear my soul singing the lullaby that the diary created every evening.Buy it.  Try it.  I hope, like me, you'll love it.",4

It helped me, a natural pessimist, to take stock of and appreciate the good things in life just by asking me a few simple (and yes, repetitive) questions every single day, with a weekly set of deeper questions that ultimately helped me think about what was important in life to me.  This second volume is useful for keeping that positivity and gratitude going. I gave it only 4 stars because the weekly reflection, which I used to find sometimes challenging but definitely enlightening, has been replaced by a 'lighter' version, although I can see that it is still useful. Overall I have found that creating the habit of thinking about the positives in life, however small, has been really beneficial for me.",0

Monster munch feet, horrible yellow toenails... I know right? Absolutely horrible vision for you all, so I have tried everything, tablets nope, creams nope, everything! but then a vet friend said hey, try this product which is mainly used for animals. I laughed, then had more wine and thought ahhh... Go on, and my goodness what a brilliant product! If your toenails are yellow, brittle... One could say like a horse hoof.... Then, this product is for you. Also just want to say that woman who uploaded pictures of the worst case scenario complications of this product is being completely silly, I mean it's exactly the same principle when you take any medication, they say 1 in 10,000 MIGHT suffer a reaction so pffttt. I've not started barking yet so I'm pretty sure it's safe AND I have healthy nails... *neigh*",43

"Hibiscrub Health Care, 500ml",Health Care,7.50,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-03-26,"Thankfully, I thought about this product as soon as the virus that we all want to be eradicated raised its head. Well, this was probably my best purchase for sanitising my hands. This gel is antiseptic and given it is used before conducting surgery and minor operations, I think it's effectiveness is unquestionable.

I am very thorough when washing my hands and usually rub the gel into my hands for around 3 minutes, with close attention to all areas and under the nails. However, the peace of mind afterwards is fantastic, as even though I take a sanitizer with me too, you feel ""bulletproof"" knowing this product has a residual effect for up to 6 hours!

The smell is pleasant and I have not had any allergic reaction despite having sensitive skin. However, this handwash is not cheap but you get what you pay for, so the peace of mind is worth every penny!!!",4

If I could find fault, it's that this 500ml bottle doesn't come with a dispenser top, so you'll most likely need to pour it into a more handy bottle, but the smaller versions come with pour tops so get one of those and then one of these once the smaller is finished.",0

"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",Health Care,nan,3.0,United Kingdom,2020-02-07,"We bought this as first time parents. Everything is fine but I wouldn‚Äôt buy again or reccomended to other parents. The Hairbrush is nice and gentle but a bit Plasticky, the nail cutters are ok but we found that they weren‚Äôt sharp enough and actually bought a small high quality pair which is way more effective, the nose sucker is way too big for a newborn and not that great later on (we ended up buying the Braun electric one after trying various other solutions). The comb is just a comb. We haven‚Äôt used the scissors. The only thing of any use is the thermometer, you can just buy one from a pharmacy as save the money and in end we ended up getting a forehead one when our daughter was 9 months because she wouldn‚Äôt stay still long enough to check her under the arm. So all in all a nice idea but a waste of money as we either didn‚Äôt use things or we bought better alternatives down the line.",9
"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",Health Care,nan,1.0,United Kingdom,2020-05-06,Don‚Äôt bother! The only thing I‚Äôve used is the hair brush!The nail file is too harsh for the nailsThe nasal aspirator is too big for the nostril and has no suck power.The thermometer takes way too long to do a reading (especially on an upset baby!) and is NOT accurate - tested  on myself,3
"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",Health Care,nan,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-05-23,This grooming kit would be an ideal gift for any parent to be. It has more or less everything you would need. Super easy to use and comes in a pouch which you can take anywhere with you. Baby scissors are perfect for trimming nails. The brush and comb set are food quality bristles are nice and soft. The only thing I didn't like from the kit was the nasal aspirator there is hardly any suction on there and did not clean her nose at all couldn't pull anything out. We ended up buying the snuffle babe nasal aspirator which is amazing. I would still recommend this grooming kit as it is worth the price as everything else is really good.,1
"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",Health Care,nan,3.0,United Kingdom,2020-04-11,"I bought this set because I thought I'd get good value for money and use most of the pieces, but nope. The opening of the nasal aspirator is definitely too big for a newborn, it was even too big for our baby when he had a cold when he was three months old. The nail clipper is too sharp, but I find the scissors are great. I used the brush a few times, but never the comb (though maybe you will if your baby has lots of hair). The thermometre is ok, though pretty slow. All in all, unless you could really use the case (it is handy for travelling), just buy the things you'll really use separately.",0
"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",Health Care,nan,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-07-17,"This is a must for your baby.I bought this for my baby and I also bought it for my friend's babies because is just amazing.The scissors are perfect to cut little ones nails,we used the brush for the cradle and was really helpful.My little one loves the tooth brush to play with,seems like it is helping her with teething.We didn't really use the thermometer because we have an ear one.Overall really happy with the product.",0
"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",Health Care,nan,1.0,United Kingdom,2020-02-16,The only thing I use after having this for 3 months is the hair brush. Notably useless are the ‚Äúsuction‚Äù nose thing and the thermometer. The nail clippers are downright dangerous. Using them on a conscious baby that will move around will lead very quickly to cutting their fingers.,2
"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",Health Care,nan,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-01-14,As I‚Äôve written in previous reviews - baby shopping is expensive and exhausting. Have also been looking at all in one baby kits in various shops and haven‚Äôt found anything that includes all these items for a special price. Should‚Äôve come to amazon in the first place. And I was lucky as the price dropped before I purchased this. So winning with this purchase. With Tommy tippie being a trusted brand I had no fear in purchasing this and I was right. Go ahead mums (and dads).,0
"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",Health Care,nan,4.0,United Kingdom,2020-01-27,"At first, thought this was a little expensive for what it was. However, over time it has proven to be very useful. Have mainly used the hairbrush, nail scissors, thermometer and nose aid. Which have lasted since my daughter was around 8 weeks up until now she is 21 months. The zip up case is lightweight and of good quality. Glad I bought this in the end!",0
"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",Health Care,nan,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-04-27,"Great little grooming set for babies, has everything you need, and is compact, so does not take up much space. All the items were very well, especially the nail clippers and scissors. All of the products are made with quality materials and don‚Äôt think you could get a better set than this. Brilliant grooming kit.",0
"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",Health Care,nan,3.0,United Kingdom,2020-06-03,"Im annoyed the thermometer batteries don't work. Luckily I've not had the little one yet and just thought I'd try it out and see what my temp is and it just flashes LO then goes blank. hoping so much it's not a used /returned product because it's been in my mouth!!!Perfect as a travel wallet and handy to keep the bits together, so will keep it for that reason but would have expected all parts to be usable upon purchase.Brushes and nail files won't be getting any use as not needed on a baby (which I only found out recently on an antenatal video) but it was cheap so I guess it's handy in that respect.a wallet with fewer better quality pcs would be a winner in my eyes!",0
"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",Health Care,nan,2.0,United Kingdom,2020-02-24,"The only useful bits are the snot sucker (although my baby very much doesn't like it!) and the brush. The thermometer is useless as takes ages to take a reading which is no good on a baby (better to buy an ear one), nail clippers are fiddly. It's ok for the money but ud say not all that useful, you could buy the bits you need for a better price separately",0
"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",Health Care,nan,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-06-26,"I‚Äôve purchased this as a gift but for the price it‚Äôs excellent and worth it for the digital thermometer alone, which are really hard to get hold of at the moment.The handy zippered case keeps everything in one place and is handy for popping into a changing bag.Definitely worth every penny.Hope you found my review helpful",0
"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",Health Care,nan,1.0,United Kingdom,2020-04-26,Nothing special about this product! Just the name.The thermometer needs to be kept in your baby:child‚Äôs mouth for 3-5 mins to give a reading.. what baby or child will stay still for 3-5 mins with something stuck in their mouth?,1
"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",Health Care,nan,3.0,United Kingdom,2020-02-27,"Not that impressed with this purchase. Everything is quite cheaply made and I ended up buying another thermometer, nasal sucker and toothbrush. You‚Äôre best off just buying everything separately. The nasal aspirator has little suction and the thermometer takes forever to read a temperature. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend this product.",0
"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",Health Care,nan,4.0,United Kingdom,2020-03-07,Four stars only because of the thermometer which isn‚Äôt so great. All other items have been quite useful. The nasal aspirator is easy to use; it‚Äôs suction is gentle yet effective. The case is easy to transport and fits snugly in the diaper bag when we‚Äôre out and about. Good product overall,0
"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",Health Care,nan,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-04-13,Great value given the contents. I really only purchased as I needed a thermometer but was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the contents and have used most items. Definitely useful to have for a newborn,0
"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",Health Care,nan,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-02-17,"I think this set comes in extremely handy, you can pack it all away easy in the case it comes with so it‚Äôs very ideal for travelling and contains so many essentials for good quality and good price!",0
"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",Health Care,nan,1.0,United Kingdom,2020-03-01,"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. I cut my baby‚Äôs big toe trying to cut his nail and it bled for 20mins. The clippers are ridiculously sharp and even when I brushed my finger across them it felt sharp and dangerous. I would stick to biting his nails and threw the clippers in the bin!! The brush is ok and the thermometer took ages to get a reading, the nail file is useless - overall not happy at all and quite traumatised.",1
"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",Health Care,nan,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-01-16,Great little set for newborn baby; read some reviews that the brush bristles were hard?!

"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",Health Care,nan,4.0,United Kingdom,2020-03-09,"I bought this for the nasal sucker and I must say it is awful! Doesnt work at all, if this is your soul reason for purchase then I really wouldnt recommend; however, the rest of the products included are good hence the score. It's great its all in one bag so you can pop in changing back or suitcase when going away. Soft brushes and great nail scissors/ clippers",0
"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",Health Care,nan,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-07-06,Very handy to have. I have it with me all the time and it's a part of my babys changing/travel bag. It's a essential for every mum and the Tommy Tippie brand is the best one,0

"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",Health Care,nan,1.0,United Kingdom,2020-01-24,"Originally I thought this was a good product to get us started, however the constituent elements are not as good as if you bought them on their own. For example, the nasal aspirator was ineffective, and we have had to replace it, and the thermometer gives inaccurate readings, stuck at around 35.4 (which is hypothermic for a baby). Again, I have paid to replace this. In hindsight, I wouldn't buy a cheap all-in-one kit like this again.",0

"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",Health Care,nan,1.0,United Kingdom,2019-12-18,"Awful quality, there's nothing in this set that can actually be used. I had to buy every single item separately. I'll give you a few reasons for not buying this product. 1. The nail clip blade is extremely sharp and presents some irregularities. I've tried to cut my newborn nails and just by touching it cut my baby's skin, haven't even pressed on it. Checking it on with my finger I have realised it's too sharp. 2. Baby brush and comb... seriously? Those are not suitable for delicate baby skin, the bristles are too strong. 3. Digital thermometer - that should be posed under baby's arm or mouth to give the temperature... that's a joke. First of all, baby is wriggling too much and it's impossible to keep the thermometer in position under arm for around 1 minute. Secondly, you can't make the baby keep the mouth shut for a better temperature measurement... otherwise, I've tested on my own mouth and was giving a result of 34deg Celsius which is impossible. 4. Nose cleaner - there are better products out there that can actually do the job. 5. Nail file - single use. 6. Teeth brush for newborn and baby? The brush has plastic bristles which are not suitable for baby that can chew and swallow. Unfortunately, I cannot return it as I bought this product long time in advance before the baby was born. But please make yourself a favour and avoid buying this.",0
"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",Health Care,nan,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-02-28,"Great little kit, especially when you have a newborn with a cold. I love the small Emery boards to help keep those sharp little nails down. The only thing that I find fiddly is the thermometer which you have to hold in place for quite some time to get an accurate reading.",0
"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",Health Care,nan,1.0,United Kingdom,2020-03-12,The most important item in this kit is the thermometer. My baby is poorly and I went to take his temperature and the thermometer is dead. The first time I come to use it and the battery dies. Really unacceptable given that I need to take his temperature in an emergency.,0
"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",Health Care,nan,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-05-22,Bought to get the thermometer as they were very difficult to get hold of at the time. Gave the rest to a friend who was expecting. She was very pleased.,0
"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",Health Care,nan,1.0,United Kingdom,2020-05-08,"Honestly just cheap and useless tat made solely to feel like a worried mum and dad to be are prepared. When push comes to shove and you need it with a newborn, this stuff is useless. There is place in hell reserved for whoever thought the thermometer would work for a wriggly newborn. Cheap tat. Avoid.",0
"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",Health Care,nan,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-01-17,A neat little kit full of some essential pieces of equipment.,0

"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",Health Care,nan,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-05-30,Perfect little health care pack for your baby. Everything is easy to use and I find it most useful. The nail clippers are great and the little hair brush is excellent for cradle cap. We haven't used many of the other items yet but I'm sure we will. It's a great kit.,0
"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",Health Care,nan,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-06-27,"A great thing to have in the drawer for your newborn. It‚Äôs has everything you need any more to get you started.

I‚Äôm not thrilled with the thermometer, although it does get the job done. I think I will spend more on a better one in the future (more than what the whole kit costs).

The brush leaves my daughters hair lovely and the nail clippers work a treat.",0
"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",Health Care,nan,3.0,United Kingdom,2020-01-11,"This pack is just as every other pack like this you can find. Yes it‚Äôs practical, but he brush is not very soft, and the items are not great quality. If it‚Äôs all you can afford yes it does the job but I do advise in buying the items separated instead . My thermometer does not seem very accurate either.",0
"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",Health Care,nan,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-05-12,"Has everything you need for baby, although I mainly use the thermometer/files/clippers...baby doesn‚Äôt have any hair so we don‚Äôt use the brush yet..I let baby suck/chew on the toothbrush as he‚Äôs only 4 months but he likes it on his gums. We don‚Äôt use the nasal sucker as we have a different one",0
"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",Health Care,nan,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-06-26,I bought this for my child. It was easy to use. The delivery was quick and the price was reasonable. Also the communications from seller were quick. Very convenient to use during travelling.,0
"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",Health Care,nan,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-06-20,"It actually is good. When I first saw the scissors, I decided that they are complete useless and didn't even attempt to use them. Then 4 months later decided to try them out and realised that they actually are great for baby nails.",0
"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",Health Care,nan,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-04-04,Great little kit for our little one the scissors are handy for cutting her small finger nails and the rest of the kit seems OK from what we have used.,0
"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",Health Care,nan,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-07-02,This is a gift for our newest arrival.  Good pack of needed tools easy to use and store.

"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",Health Care,nan,3.0,United Kingdom,2020-02-12,"It's a set, yes handy to keep all the goods in one place, but my disappointment is with the fact hat some of the items don't really work.... Thermometer is bad, not showing correctly, the nose pump is too big for a baby nostrils. I wouldn't buy 5his again",0
"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",Health Care,nan,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-05-11,"Every thing you would need for a baby all in one place, not sur about the suction pump as it looks really big for a new born child.",0

"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",Health Care,nan,3.0,United Kingdom,2020-01-09,"Expensive for what it is and the thermometer takes so long to read it is pointless, unless your baby never moves you will not be able to get their temperature.",0
"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",Health Care,nan,2.0,United Kingdom,2020-07-01,"Quality is okay I only use the scissors for my new born baby which I love , I tried to use the nose sucker but I feel that the thing is too big nor a newborn baby nose so I couldn't use it , the brush I feel that is not soft enough maybe for an older baby is better .",0
"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",Health Care,nan,3.0,United Kingdom,2019-12-06,This kit is okay...its meant for an older kid. The brush is not very soft for a new born and basal aspirator is too large for baby even at 4 months.,0

"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",Health Care,nan,2.0,United Kingdom,2020-06-27,Item arrived in bad condition. The hair brush was damaged so had to return it.  The thermometer was not accurate as every time it read 34-35 degrees on me.,0
"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",Health Care,nan,3.0,United Kingdom,2020-06-22,"Before having my son, I thought I  would use all the products but I didn't. I mostly use the nail clipper, comb, brush and emergy board. The thermometer is okay but I prefer the thermometer which goes in the ear as I think that gives the best results and I have noticed many doctors using thermometers that go in the ear as well. The Nasal Aspirator is way too big especially to use on a baby that is under 2 months. And the toothbrush is not soft at all. I think its better to buy individual products rather than the whole set. I love Tommee Tippee products but I was not a big fan of this one.",0

"Lictin Baby Health Care Kit - Baby Grooming Kit Newborn Baby Care Accessories, 15PCS Safety Cutter Nail Care Set",Health Care,14.99,3.0,United Kingdom,2020-07-17,Bought it instead of the Tommy tippee one as this has more things that may be of use. Haven't used all the items but the nail cutter is fab! The soft brush however has completely lost its shape and squished up when it was squashed in the box with the other items,4
"Lictin Baby Health Care Kit - Baby Grooming Kit Newborn Baby Care Accessories, 15PCS Safety Cutter Nail Care Set",Health Care,14.99,4.0,United Kingdom,2019-12-27,Really like the travel bag its solid and looks good. The only negative is the comb is damaged it's all bent and unusable. The rest of the products are of a high standard.,3
"Lictin Baby Health Care Kit - Baby Grooming Kit Newborn Baby Care Accessories, 15PCS Safety Cutter Nail Care Set",Health Care,14.99,1.0,United Kingdom,2020-06-12,"In the future i will avoid this seller for miles. This kit arrived to me just as a big mess, the lightening termometer is broken, it doesnt light at all and the temperature reader one is not working either. I request refund with return and nobody came back to me. Just big NO!",2
"Lictin Baby Health Care Kit - Baby Grooming Kit Newborn Baby Care Accessories, 15PCS Safety Cutter Nail Care Set",Health Care,14.99,3.0,United Kingdom,2020-04-30,"Cheap set, cheap products inside.First for purpose but I would advise going a little bit more expensive and buying each piece of the kit separately.",3
"Lictin Baby Health Care Kit - Baby Grooming Kit Newborn Baby Care Accessories, 15PCS Safety Cutter Nail Care Set",Health Care,14.99,3.0,United Kingdom,2020-06-20,The product as a whole works. Some aspects seem cheap but the set does what it should. It does include a good group of items that are used regularly with a baby. I appreciated the accurate thermometer and the baby nail files ( recommendation: file nails instead of  clipping nails for as long as possible),0
"Lictin Baby Health Care Kit - Baby Grooming Kit Newborn Baby Care Accessories, 15PCS Safety Cutter Nail Care Set",Health Care,14.99,3.0,United Kingdom,2020-04-05,Wish I spent a bit more money to get the Tommee Tippee one personally.

"Lictin Baby Health Care Kit - Baby Grooming Kit Newborn Baby Care Accessories, 15PCS Safety Cutter Nail Care Set",Health Care,14.99,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-07-05,It's a great deal. This kit has all the essential items you need for a newborn. Best is the ear cleaner as it has a small torch light in it. Only item I didn't like is the hair brush. It's soft but the bristles come off easily every time I use it on my baby's hair. But overall its a great useful kit box. Cheaper than the big brands and does the job you need.,1
"Lictin Baby Health Care Kit - Baby Grooming Kit Newborn Baby Care Accessories, 15PCS Safety Cutter Nail Care Set",Health Care,14.99,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-04-09,"Excellent quality item, although I only bought it for the thermometer, as you couldn't buy them anywhere else at the time!Great for peace of mind!",2

"Boxclever Press Luxury A5 Diary Cover. Textured Cover with Zip for A5 Diaries & Journals. Untitled Diary Covers for Nurses, Health Care Professionals, Students or Home Use. (Seaspray)",Health Care,19.99,2.0,United Kingdom,2020-01-15,"Solid with stiff board inside and the faux leather material appears quite thick. The general construction and sewing appears very good. However the item is lacking in finesse. Velcro on small pocket not aligned, so does not hold closed. However this is academic since the  pocket is not of any use.! More important, the zip, although solid, is very rough making it-for me- unusable; it jams sometimes unless I am very careful and deliberate. It reminds me of zips from 40 years ago. There is binding next to the zip. Rather than using one piece, the manufacturers have continued with a join which is unsightly and has a black mark on it. Overall the fit is tight even with a 12 cm thick A5 notebook. with a 20 mm spiral wire spine, placed inside. Personally I would have prefered if it were 5-10 mm thicker.  I am disappointed, mainly because of the zip.",3

Sometimes when I have a headache I wear it on my forehead instead of my eyes and sometimes I put a sleep mask on top to keep if on me more firmly. Theses things are great and I can‚Äôt wait to try them all! I really love the rose and lavender ones but I‚Äôm curious to see what the men‚Äôs ones are like lol.,13

Looked at the price at my usually beauty outlet and they wanted $11.50/5 as amazon wanted $15.08/12 and same day delivery.
I didn‚Äôt realize it was the exact same brand until I pulled out the GWP to compare.
MUCH better price for the same item and can‚Äôt beat delivery time.
Opened one up to try it out and the warmth was nice, I would have preferred a stronger lavender scent, but after some fiddling around I was finally able to get it to where the scent was good.
Awesome unexpected 30 minute nap.
These puppies will be awesome anytime you want to relax...",1

My buns had a mild stomachache and I thankfully had this on hand (i highly recommend that you buy this NOW and keep it in your freezer for emergencies). She at first wasn't sure about it but she finally got a taste and sucked it down no problem. She loves this stuff so much (and it gives her amazing energy) that I now feed it to her as a supplement every other day to help with digestion and as a precaution. I do one tsp of the powder and 2 tsps of warm water in a shot glass and stir it into a slurry and top it onto her hay.,9

"Oxbow Animal Health Critical Care, Herbivore, Apple-Banana Flavor, 141 Gram Bag",Health Care,nan,5.0,United States,2020-01-06,"Before moving to Florida from NY Ik bought this as a safe measure, just in case... well the whole way there I was extremely worried, he started to stop eating and acting weird, lethargic, panting, no interest, stoped pooping and peeing. I started to force feed him this. It was a little hard to mix up, and stayed a bit chunky. But other than that. The minute we arrived to my new apartment, we dropped everything off, and rushed him to the vet. It was a very big vet bill, and he had to stay over night. But the vet said that if it weren‚Äôt for this he would have already been dead. I owe it to this company, it saved his life. Definitely buy this to at least keep on hand, it‚Äôs hard to find in stores, and when you need it there‚Äôs nothing you can do, and things can go downhill very quickly.",0
"Oxbow Animal Health Critical Care, Herbivore, Apple-Banana Flavor, 141 Gram Bag",Health Care,nan,5.0,United States,2019-12-16,"My rabbit Chubbs had GI Stasis back in October and this helped bring him out of it. He ended up sick again with something else 3-4 weeks ago. The vet couldn‚Äôt figure out what was wrong. I went ahead and bought more of this and it kept him going. He has since passed, but I do recommend this product. It gives them what they need to help when they are sick.

Everyone rallied quickly after having this without any negative side effects. My vet recommended it. I keep it on hand in the freezer in case any foundlings come to the house. I think it's funny that the review asks you to rate the flavor, but the bearded dragon won't answer me when I ask him about that, so I just gave it 5/5. The cat begs for it, so that's a good sign. It smells like armpit, though.",0

I read all the reviews and prayed it would work for me too... and it did!!!  I am 46 years old and in the worst part of menopause ...hot flashes , night sweats ...miserable !  Then... I start itching ...uncontrollably !  I‚Äôm single ... haven‚Äôt been intimate with anyone ...asking myself what the hell is happening down there?!?  Not just itching but also breaking out in acne ...down there!!  This has been going on for months!!  Can‚Äôt get into a doctor because of COVID-19....so I start researching and I find that ...all the symptoms of bacterial vaginosis appear to be what I‚Äôm experiencing.  I took the pill as soon as I got them in the mail...about 4pm in the afternoon.  I swear to the gods....by 9pm ...I wasn‚Äôt itching at all !  I felt more normal than I had in months !  I wanted to cry !  I‚Äôve been taking them for a week and it just keeps getting better everyday!  And the acne is going away as well!

My roommate said she'd been taking vaginal probiotics with great results (less yeast infections after her period, more lubrication, etc), but given I already take 50bil cfu probiotics for gut health, I thought it was hoopla. Until now.

Over the past several months, when I start sweating even a little, everything smells. I would walk from my car to work, and get a whiff of myself. After working out or running with friends, I'd be too embarassed to hang around. I could shower before bed, and still need to shower when I get up. I carried extra deo, underwear, and feminine wipes in my purse, gym bag, desk, work backpack. You get the idea. With summer here I was begrudgingly prepared to keep this routine. I'd talked to my gynecologist who had found nothing amiss.

3 days taking these, I noticed a difference, but didn't want to jinx it. 2 weeks in, and I have to say these have changed my life. I don't stink when I sweat, and I don't have to keep a whole bathroom in my purse! No reapplying deo multiple times a day, no multiple showers when I'm not leaving the house!

I have struggled with the PH in my body for the last 4 years. I‚Äôve been to various doctors thinking something was wrong. I‚Äôve given up gluten and dairy. I‚Äôve tried low fodmap diets. I‚Äôve quit eating sugar. I‚Äôve done Keto and low carb and I even tried intermittent fasting. Nothing ever seemed to work. I‚Äôve tried a dozen different probiotics and I‚Äôve used digestive enzymes for years. I really wasn‚Äôt optimistic even though I read the reviews and was hopeful. This probiotic is a game changer. I‚Äôm going on day three and I can already start to feel it working. I am so incredibly thankful and am optimistic that foods I have not been able to eat I soon may be able to enjoy again.

First - the product itself is fine but the oversized plastic container that houses the caplets was disgusting. Upon opening the container, it reeked of chemicals. The smell was so pungent that I rehoused the caplets in a spare glass bottle. I decided to go to our local health food store and buy the refrigerated version of this exact brand. Comes in nice glass bottle and it was the same price. After I use this product for three months - I‚Äôll edit my review with regards to its efficiency.ONE MONTH UPDATE: Upgraded my rating from a 3 to 5. I am extremely pleased with this product.

(All my paps were normal my whole life, I was checked out) So I assume that my goofed up cycle was contributing to my long bout of anxiety...and then my anxiety messed up my Ph levels, because I got a BAD and STUBBORN yeast infection. 4 days of diflucan at first, then it came back, or lingered for 2 weeks after. I went to P.Parenthood because, still had a discharge. She looked under the microscope,  YEAST. Miserable. She prescribed me a higher dose of diflucan that I took once every 4 days, instead of each day in a row. That did the trick.However, things still were not of normal smell down there, actually, it was a lack of smell. As if there was no good bacteria. Discharge was dry. I battled this thing for a month and a half. It was SO upsetting which of course made my mental health feel way worse. My husband is usually supportive but he was sick of hearing me complain. I was just done, so I found these. Took for a month straight. WOW. What a game changer. My mood was lifted a little bit, and everything back to normal down there. Yes the diflucan did help, but this is what brought the Ph back to balance. The yeast infection did not come back!Since, I started self hypnotherapy.

"The 6-Minute Diary | Gratitude Journal for Men & Women, Mindfulness Journal | 6 Minutes a Day for more Self Care, Mental Health & Happiness",Health Care,nan,1.0,United Kingdom,2020-01-05,I persevered with this for a couple of months but found it really tricky to use. I couldn‚Äôt think of anything to write without being repetitive. I had to look online for positive affirmations after I‚Äôd constantly repeated the limited few I could think up myself. I am very grateful for many things in my life but I couldn‚Äôt think of enough to keep the diary interesting and repeated the same few things over and over again. Doing a good deed every day is tricky when you work alone most of the time so I had to put down daily jobs such as cooking dinner for me and my husband or walking the dogs. After about two months of repetitive writing I felt that the diary had provided me with absolutely no benefit at all. I prefer taking a walk with my dogs or spending time outdoors in my garden when the weather is good. That had a far better effect on my mind and sense of well-being. This may work for some people but I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it to anyone I know because my friends and family are quite similar to me and they wouldn‚Äôt know what to write.,6
"The 6-Minute Diary | Gratitude Journal for Men & Women, Mindfulness Journal | 6 Minutes a Day for more Self Care, Mental Health & Happiness",Health Care,nan,1.0,United Kingdom,2020-02-23,"Really not a fan of the layout/ structure. Large portion of the diary is dedicated to talking about self improvement and is full of inspirational stories etc almost like a novel, this eats into paper which could have been used as actual diary space. I threw this out after a week of trying to use it. If I wanted a novel I'd have bought one. This doesn't fall under the category of diaries  - you'd be as well taking a piece of paper and writing three things you feel grateful for in the morning as that's really the only thing this offers (and you'd save yourself a heap of Money).",4
"The 6-Minute Diary | Gratitude Journal for Men & Women, Mindfulness Journal | 6 Minutes a Day for more Self Care, Mental Health & Happiness",Health Care,nan,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-05-31,"I bought this diary at a point where I was burnt our professionally and personally. This diary has some reading at the beginning to explain how it works and evidence to back it up. You then begin with a little self assessment scoring everything from your overall mood to finances and relationships from 1 to 10. You will repeat this month by month and it‚Äôs a good way to see how you change.This is a very structured gratitude journal which makes it easy to do. Literally 3 mins in the morning and 3 mins in the evening. What you are grateful for, a positive affirmation in the morning and similar in the evening. There are weekly questions that really make you think.I loved this diary. It has changed my life for the better. It has a habit tracker and has helped me now also incorporate daily meditation into my life.I recommend this to anyone, struggling or not. For those of you who have read Rangan Chaterjee‚Äôs ‚Äúthe stress solution‚Äù, this diary helps you with most of the recommendations in the beginning of the book. You won‚Äôt regret getting it.",2
"The 6-Minute Diary | Gratitude Journal for Men & Women, Mindfulness Journal | 6 Minutes a Day for more Self Care, Mental Health & Happiness",Health Care,nan,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-06-30,I decided to buy this after a very traumatic experience. My mental health was suffering and I felt I needed to focus on looking at the positive things. This has helped me so much. It doesn‚Äôt take much time so I don‚Äôt feel overwhelmed by it. It is good to journal things that have happened in more detail but focus on the little positive steps towards recovery as well as realising I have a lot to be grateful for. I have also used it as a daily focus for my 14 year old son but he does it verbally. It‚Äôs lovely to hear him talk about things he is grateful for. It has helped us both understand that even when life seems really tough there are things to be grateful for and great things still happen. It makes me think of the saying ‚ÄúEnjoy the little things because one day you will look back and realise that they were the big things‚Äù. I have found this so useful for the last six months that I have now bought the follow on version to continue for the next six months. I would recommend this to anyone who is struggling and perhaps may feel overwhelmed by having to write a lot each day. This is meant to only take 3 minutes in the morning and another 3 minutes at night but there is space to record longer thoughts at the end of each week and at the back of the planner. It‚Äôs really good.,1

Despite reading negative reviews I made the purchase.. The first 60 pages are uncomfortable to read - kind of reminds me of a poorly written leaflet someone would hand you about God. Once you get passed this, the diary is only 66 pages long and has terribly chosen quotes from the likes of Richard Branson? Love the idea of this book as it is something I practice daily already - but terribly executed to the point of embarrassing, unfortunately.",5
"The 6-Minute Diary | Gratitude Journal for Men & Women, Mindfulness Journal | 6 Minutes a Day for more Self Care, Mental Health & Happiness",Health Care,nan,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-02-03,"I bought this to go with a couple of books for my children (the 5 minute diary for the eldest and the 3 minute one for the younger child)... My initial objective was to get them to be grateful for their dinner... even if it's NOT chicken nuggets... be grateful you have food, you have warmth, you have comfort, even if the dinner had REAL chicken in it, as well as mushrooms!!! ... and that seemed to work, we got over that, not entirely of course, but a lesson has been learned (somewhat) in that department...
The unexpected by product of this experience however, is that THIS book grabbed my attention... it's not 'just' a gratitude journal which you write stuff down, it's the preamble, it's the all the information up front - the bit about why you're doing it in the first place...
That's what hooked me...
And then practicing the ritual with my daughters each day.
And at first, it was clutching at the obvious; grateful for food, water, clothes, warmth
But then something started to change, unexpectedly so... I started to dig deeper and feel more positive...
My gratitude now involves; realising my self worth and what I mean to my children, recognising what we have, not what we don't, grateful for opportunities and more meaningful, deeper reflection when it comes to positive affirmations....and one of my good deeds today, was simply 'Acceptance'... and 'Acceptance with grace'...
I love this book.
I have recommended and even bought copies for friends and colleagues...
I am more positive, more energised, more determined and dare I say happier in myself... I didn't even realise I needed changing, my days had been focused on other people and things and work and jobs which needed doing, that I forgot myself along the way. But I'm back now... and it feels great :)",2

Specially if you are already a little bit of a positive person.Won't recommend it at all unless you are some sort of masochist that takes insane pleasure of writing (and answering) the same things time after time after time.,2
"The 6-Minute Diary | Gratitude Journal for Men & Women, Mindfulness Journal | 6 Minutes a Day for more Self Care, Mental Health & Happiness",Health Care,nan,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-07-01,"I am absolutely hopeless with sticking to new things that are good for me long-term, whether it's eating healthily or exercising - but this is brilliant. It's such an easy habit to get into, as it requires minimal time input and no equipment (well, other than a pen). I mean, who doesn't have a few minutes each day?

When I first started using it, I found it incredibly difficult to think of good deeds for the day or good things that happened during the day, which says a lot in itself, but this makes me more aware of the good going on in life. I still struggle occasionally, but like the fact that this forces me to find the positive. It's making me noticeably more positive as time goes on and I've recommended it to lots of my friends and colleagues.

If you're on the fence about buying it, I'd ask 'what have you got to lose?'. I'm sure you've spent more on other potential 'fads' in the past, but this is a long-term investment, that doesn't go off or go to waste. Go for it!",2
"The 6-Minute Diary | Gratitude Journal for Men & Women, Mindfulness Journal | 6 Minutes a Day for more Self Care, Mental Health & Happiness",Health Care,nan,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-03-14,"After a difficult period in life I‚Äôve been writing a journal to try and offload some thoughts and feelings. This has helped a lot but often the negative thoughts far outweigh the good.

This diary has already helped me. I‚Äôve used it less than a week but the timing to write.. first thing in the morning and last thing at night give perfect opportunity to start and end the day better.
My old pattern was to remember the sad aspects too much.
I‚Äôm the kind of person that recognises things I‚Äôm grateful for often but then during a difficult day or hour, it‚Äôs all too easy to push my feelings of great fullness to the back of my mind. Therefore the negative thoughts take over.

Do read all the pages before starting to write the diary. They are incredibly helpful to understand why you should write and ideas of what will be helpful to write.

I‚Äôm also incredibly interested in psychology and this ticked my box for personal interest too, as well as helping me personally.",1

It‚Äôs interesting to look back and see how far I‚Äôve come in my personal development over the past 6 months. This book is not as repetitive as some reviews will have you think; there are other parts to the book which are different every week and just the first 66 pages of information is worth every penny you spend on this diary.

It has now fallen by the way  but it was useful to get me through that phase. One affirmation that has stuck is ""listen more"".There is quite a lot of reading to get through before you can start.The paper is lovely quality, but still expensive",0

Recently had ankle surgery which has left me immobile for 6 weeks which had massively affected my mindset and mood. Got back to work today and was in such a great mood after decided today would be a brill day to start - why wait til New Year?!

I absolutely love this so far! There is a very lengthy intro to the book but it is full of information for you to get the most out of using this diary.
I'm certain it will be easy to stick to as the daily inputs are brief - but get you thinking.

The book itself is stunning - pages are thick which will be ideal for the entries. Very stury design.

So excited to keep progressing with this and would highly recommend.",0

I definitely see this item working for only a particular type of person. I would not call myself lazy but I found the repetitive questions everyday kinda hard and boring to answer but I am writing this during quarantine where I am self-isolating at home so it will try to use it again after I go back to work. There are a good few quotes and explanations at the start that was kinda repetitive and I did not finish reading them but I can say that the exercise itself did out me in a positive mood instantly. maybe a bit too expensive for the book.,0

The best recommendation I can give is that I have bought the follow up Pure. Like the daily quotes and the gratitude practice really makes a difference to not taking things for granted which can so easily be the case with our natural tendency for hedonic adaptation.One bit of feedback would be to include some more real life examples if possible for people just starting out so they can ease into things. Certainly took me longer than 3mins for the morning routine in the beginning which slightly hinders habit formation. I got there in the end and everyone will find what works for them from using this journal and tutorial bit at the start. Enjoy! X",0

I used the first version for 6 months and have now started on the Pure edition. This takes your thinking to the next level. There are suggested guidelines, but really it's up to you to decide what you want to focus on, in terms of Gratitude in your day. In a busy world, where time is of the essence, to sit down in the morning with a cuppa and consider what/who you are greatful for is a positive way to start the day. Similarly to reflect in the evening brings everything together. I was reviewing my first journal and it brought back happy memories of the small things that made me smile, in a big life that sometimes doesn't. I've found this process invaluable for my postive mental health. Highly recommended.",0

I found being prompted to think in this way very jarring at first. It's completely contrary to how my brain works, which is why I need it. It's very simple to do and not too full of the usual self help tropes that catch in my cynical throat.

Was a bit sceptical but have found it so helpful especially in the present climate of covid-19 that I have sent it as a gift to several friends. I have just completed the book and purchased the follow on diary to continue my journey.

My progress from the start to the end despite lockdown and a world pandemic is proof of benefit.,1

I‚Äôm not really one for self-help so when I was given it as a birthday gift, I smiled and said thanks and forgot about it for nearly 6 months. Then I had a mental health breakdown. I found the diary by accident and decided to try. The guidance at the beginning really resonated but for the first week I found it really hard. The hardest part was the affirmation- not my thing at all. To tackle this, I chose to find a daily affirmation on Instagram that spoke to me that day.Six months on and I‚Äôm the happiest and most at peace than I‚Äôve ever been.

I gave myself a week to read through the introduction and familiarise myself with how I should be using this day and night, I am not great at expressing myself so this was great assistance.

Two courses of antibiotics didn‚Äôt help at all. I‚Äôd post some before and after pics but nobody wants to see that. Pretty horrific 4 inch open wound. Bought this in desperation and, within 3 days, the wound was clearing up beautifully.

Not even 6 hours after the grass being cut they had both started to scratch and chew their paws.

I have tried many many creams and spray over the years, including various (expensive) treatments from the vet and even the use of steroids for one of them as she had got so bad she was going bald with all her itching!

My male had managed to scratch a horrible sore onto his stomach area, I had tried treating it with another well- known dog anti itch brand for several days with no luck what so ever and figured it was going to have to be another vet trip before the cut turned into a full-blown wound and would get infected. I had seen this spray advertised several times but to be honest, I just assumed it would be the same as all the others I already have sitting in the cupboard which didn't work for us. However, when telling a friend I was going to have to take him back to the vet she recommended trying Leucillin Antiseptic Skin Care Spray and told me her vet uses it and that she had had great results too so decided it was worth a go.

Item arrived really quickly and spraying it onto the cut didn't seem to bother him at all. Within a day the sore had already started to look better. Even better my dog was no longer scratching at the area or trying to constantly lick it. Have used the spray for 3 days (twice a day although it does recommend 3 times) and today the area has completely healed and no longer red or sore. My other Maltese hasn't been as bad (so far) this year however she has been chewing at her paws a bit. I have given her feet a quick spray once a day and that alone seems to be enough to stop her biting and causing more harm.

Am truly amazed by how well it has worked, although have to say I'm a little annoyed I didn't purchase it sooner as I would have saved the dogs many summers of itching misery and myself many large vet bills!",3

"The 6-Minute Diary Pure | Gratitude Journal, Mindfulness Journal for Men & Women | 6 Minutes a Day for more Mental Health, Happiness & Self Care",Health Care,nan,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-01-29,"I bought this to go with a couple of books for my children (the 5 minute diary for the eldest and the 3 minute one for the younger child)... My initial objective was to get them to be grateful for their dinner... even if it's NOT chicken nuggets... be grateful you have food, you have warmth, you have comfort, even if the dinner had REAL chicken in it, as well as mushrooms!!! ... and that seemed to work, we got over that, not entirely of course, but a lesson has been learned (somewhat) in that department...
The unexpected by product of this experience however, is that THIS book grabbed my attention... it's not 'just' a gratitude journal which you write stuff down, it's the preamble, it's the all the information up front - the bit about why you're doing it in the first place...
That's what hooked me...
And then practicing the ritual with my daughters each day.
And at first, it was clutching at the obvious; grateful for food, water, clothes, warmth
But then something started to change, unexpectedly so... I started to dig deeper and feel more positive...
My gratitude now involves; realising my self worth and what I mean to my children, recognising what we have, not what we don't, grateful for opportunities and more meaningful, deeper reflection when it comes to positive affirmations....and one of my good deeds today, was simply 'Acceptance'... and 'Acceptance with grace'...
I love this book.
I have recommended and even bought copies for friends and colleagues...
I am more positive, more energised, more determined and dare I say happier in myself... I didn't even realise I needed changing, my days had been focused on other people and things and work and jobs which needed doing, that I forgot myself along the way. But I'm back now... and it feels great :)",13
"The 6-Minute Diary Pure | Gratitude Journal, Mindfulness Journal for Men & Women | 6 Minutes a Day for more Mental Health, Happiness & Self Care",Health Care,nan,5.0,United Kingdom,2019-12-26,"I absolutely love this product.  I started with the Six Minute Diary but was rather half-hearted about it - thinking it couldn't possibly be just six minutes a day... but it arrived and I filled it in that day ... and the next day... and the next day...I loved the daily quotes/affirmations;  I loved the fact that the statements/questions are simple and straightforward and didn't make it feel like an exam or that there was a ""wrong answer"".  I just love it.So much that as I filled it in one day.. then the next... then the next... I came to the end of it.  I was delighted and disappointed all at the same time... so I immediately ordered the Six Minute Diary Plus... and am very much looking to not only continuing my morning and evening ""journalling"" (which has improved my focus on my life, my goals, what I will accept and what is unacceptable to me) and I have high hopes that ""Plus"" will allow me to continue to start and end each day in a positive, productive, pro-active mindset - which has had a massive beneficial impact on so many other aspects of my life.I'm going to end here because I know I'm beginning to sound evangelical about it... but I really can't recommend it highly enough.  Buy it and tell yourself ""I'll give it my best shot for a week""... don't look at the whole book and think I'll never get to the end... just tell yourself ""seven days"".  That's what I did... but the first seven days were followed by the second seven days.. then the third ... and the fourth... and ... on those days where I couldn't fill it in first thing (with a cup of coffee in bed) ... I missed it.  My day didn't ""start right""... and on those rare occasions where I couldn't end my day positively reflecting on all the good things that had happened... I went to sleep with my heart that little bit less content .. and I couldn't hear my soul singing the lullaby that the diary created every evening.Buy it.  Try it.  I hope, like me, you'll love it.",4

I am on my second diary and find them incredibly helpful to not only take time to appreciate and be grateful but to focus on what needs to be done. I‚Äôve never kept up a diary but I have managed to maintain these diaries and for me, I think it‚Äôs the structure and limited time it takes to do that has been so successful for me.

I have found it to an invaluable aid to dealing with the current stresses and uncertainties we all find ourselves in.

"The 6-Minute Diary Pure | Gratitude Journal, Mindfulness Journal for Men & Women | 6 Minutes a Day for more Mental Health, Happiness & Self Care",Health Care,nan,4.0,United Kingdom,2020-04-25,"I got a lot out of the first volume of The 6-Minute Diary.  It helped me, a natural pessimist, to take stock of and appreciate the good things in life just by asking me a few simple (and yes, repetitive) questions every single day, with a weekly set of deeper questions that ultimately helped me think about what was important in life to me.  This second volume is useful for keeping that positivity and gratitude going. I gave it only 4 stars because the weekly reflection, which I used to find sometimes challenging but definitely enlightening, has been replaced by a 'lighter' version, although I can see that it is still useful. Overall I have found that creating the habit of thinking about the positives in life, however small, has been really beneficial for me.",0

I couldn't get on with it, I needed to get out of the samey same every day, I ended up getting a different journal which catered for what I wanted.

Monster munch feet, horrible yellow toenails... I know right? Absolutely horrible vision for you all, so I have tried everything, tablets nope, creams nope, everything! but then a vet friend said hey, try this product which is mainly used for animals. I laughed, then had more wine and thought ahhh... Go on, and my goodness what a brilliant product! If your toenails are yellow, brittle... One could say like a horse hoof.... Then, this product is for you. Also just want to say that woman who uploaded pictures of the worst case scenario complications of this product is being completely silly, I mean it's exactly the same principle when you take any medication, they say 1 in 10,000 MIGHT suffer a reaction so pffttt. I've not started barking yet so I'm pretty sure it's safe AND I have healthy nails... *neigh*",42

The hibiclens was amazing, after one day of using it i saw the biggest results, the stubborn spots on my face was shrinking and my pores were smaller than ever. BUT make sure you‚Äôre not using this everyday. Use it at night every 2 days as it could make your face more sensitive and it can worsen your face but if used the right way it could make you look amazing!",8
"Hibiscrub Health Care, 500ml",Health Care,7.50,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-03-26,"Thankfully, I thought about this product as soon as the virus that we all want to be eradicated raised its head. Well, this was probably my best purchase for sanitising my hands. This gel is antiseptic and given it is used before conducting surgery and minor operations, I think it's effectiveness is unquestionable.

I am very thorough when washing my hands and usually rub the gel into my hands for around 3 minutes, with close attention to all areas and under the nails. However, the peace of mind afterwards is fantastic, as even though I take a sanitizer with me too, you feel ""bulletproof"" knowing this product has a residual effect for up to 6 hours!

The smell is pleasant and I have not had any allergic reaction despite having sensitive skin. However, this handwash is not cheap but you get what you pay for, so the peace of mind is worth every penny!!!",4

I started using it after multiple hospital visits some years ago and haven't stopped, keeping a bottle around for anything from treating skin problems to general hand washing. If I could find fault, it's that this 500ml bottle doesn't come with a dispenser top, so you'll most likely need to pour it into a more handy bottle, but the smaller versions come with pour tops so get one of those and then one of these once the smaller is finished.",0

"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",Health Care,nan,3.0,United Kingdom,2020-02-07,"We bought this as first time parents. Everything is fine but I wouldn‚Äôt buy again or reccomended to other parents. The Hairbrush is nice and gentle but a bit Plasticky, the nail cutters are ok but we found that they weren‚Äôt sharp enough and actually bought a small high quality pair which is way more effective, the nose sucker is way too big for a newborn and not that great later on (we ended up buying the Braun electric one after trying various other solutions). The comb is just a comb. We haven‚Äôt used the scissors. The only thing of any use is the thermometer, you can just buy one from a pharmacy as save the money and in end we ended up getting a forehead one when our daughter was 9 months because she wouldn‚Äôt stay still long enough to check her under the arm. So all in all a nice idea but a waste of money as we either didn‚Äôt use things or we bought better alternatives down the line.",9
"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",Health Care,nan,1.0,United Kingdom,2020-05-06,Don‚Äôt bother! The only thing I‚Äôve used is the hair brush!The nail file is too harsh for the nailsThe nasal aspirator is too big for the nostril and has no suck power.The thermometer takes way too long to do a reading (especially on an upset baby!) and is NOT accurate - tested  on myself,3
"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",Health Care,nan,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-07-17,"This is a must for your baby.I bought this for my baby and I also bought it for my friend's babies because is just amazing.The scissors are perfect to cut little ones nails,we used the brush for the cradle and was really helpful.My little one loves the tooth brush to play with,seems like it is helping her with teething.We didn't really use the thermometer because we have an ear one.Overall really happy with the product.",0
"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",Health Care,nan,3.0,United Kingdom,2020-04-11,"I bought this set because I thought I'd get good value for money and use most of the pieces, but nope. The opening of the nasal aspirator is definitely too big for a newborn, it was even too big for our baby when he had a cold when he was three months old. The nail clipper is too sharp, but I find the scissors are great. I used the brush a few times, but never the comb (though maybe you will if your baby has lots of hair). The thermometre is ok, though pretty slow. All in all, unless you could really use the case (it is handy for travelling), just buy the things you'll really use separately.",0
"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",Health Care,nan,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-05-23,This grooming kit would be an ideal gift for any parent to be. It has more or less everything you would need. Super easy to use and comes in a pouch which you can take anywhere with you. Baby scissors are perfect for trimming nails. The brush and comb set are food quality bristles are nice and soft. The only thing I didn't like from the kit was the nasal aspirator there is hardly any suction on there and did not clean her nose at all couldn't pull anything out. We ended up buying the snuffle babe nasal aspirator which is amazing. I would still recommend this grooming kit as it is worth the price as everything else is really good.,1
"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",Health Care,nan,1.0,United Kingdom,2020-02-16,The only thing I use after having this for 3 months is the hair brush. Notably useless are the ‚Äúsuction‚Äù nose thing and the thermometer. The nail clippers are downright dangerous. Using them on a conscious baby that will move around will lead very quickly to cutting their fingers.,2
"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",Health Care,nan,4.0,United Kingdom,2020-01-27,"At first, thought this was a little expensive for what it was. However, over time it has proven to be very useful. Have mainly used the hairbrush, nail scissors, thermometer and nose aid. Which have lasted since my daughter was around 8 weeks up until now she is 21 months. The zip up case is lightweight and of good quality. Glad I bought this in the end!",0
"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",Health Care,nan,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-01-14,As I‚Äôve written in previous reviews - baby shopping is expensive and exhausting. Have also been looking at all in one baby kits in various shops and haven‚Äôt found anything that includes all these items for a special price. Should‚Äôve come to amazon in the first place. And I was lucky as the price dropped before I purchased this. So winning with this purchase. With Tommy tippie being a trusted brand I had no fear in purchasing this and I was right. Go ahead mums (and dads).,0
"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",Health Care,nan,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-04-27,"Great little grooming set for babies, has everything you need, and is compact, so does not take up much space. All the items were very well, especially the nail clippers and scissors. All of the products are made with quality materials and don‚Äôt think you could get a better set than this. Brilliant grooming kit.",0
"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",Health Care,nan,3.0,United Kingdom,2020-06-03,"Im annoyed the thermometer batteries don't work. Luckily I've not had the little one yet and just thought I'd try it out and see what my temp is and it just flashes LO then goes blank. hoping so much it's not a used /returned product because it's been in my mouth!!!Perfect as a travel wallet and handy to keep the bits together, so will keep it for that reason but would have expected all parts to be usable upon purchase.Brushes and nail files won't be getting any use as not needed on a baby (which I only found out recently on an antenatal video) but it was cheap so I guess it's handy in that respect.a wallet with fewer better quality pcs would be a winner in my eyes!",0
"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",Health Care,nan,2.0,United Kingdom,2020-02-24,"The only useful bits are the snot sucker (although my baby very much doesn't like it!) and the brush. The thermometer is useless as takes ages to take a reading which is no good on a baby (better to buy an ear one), nail clippers are fiddly. It's ok for the money but ud say not all that useful, you could buy the bits you need for a better price separately",0
"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",Health Care,nan,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-06-26,"I‚Äôve purchased this as a gift but for the price it‚Äôs excellent and worth it for the digital thermometer alone, which are really hard to get hold of at the moment.The handy zippered case keeps everything in one place and is handy for popping into a changing bag.Definitely worth every penny.Hope you found my review helpful",0
"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",Health Care,nan,3.0,United Kingdom,2020-02-27,"Not that impressed with this purchase. Everything is quite cheaply made and I ended up buying another thermometer, nasal sucker and toothbrush. You‚Äôre best off just buying everything separately. The nasal aspirator has little suction and the thermometer takes forever to read a temperature. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend this product.",0
"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",Health Care,nan,1.0,United Kingdom,2020-04-26,Nothing special about this product! Just the name.The thermometer needs to be kept in your baby:child‚Äôs mouth for 3-5 mins to give a reading.. what baby or child will stay still for 3-5 mins with something stuck in their mouth?,1
"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",Health Care,nan,4.0,United Kingdom,2020-03-07,Four stars only because of the thermometer which isn‚Äôt so great. All other items have been quite useful. The nasal aspirator is easy to use; it‚Äôs suction is gentle yet effective. The case is easy to transport and fits snugly in the diaper bag when we‚Äôre out and about. Good product overall,0
"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",Health Care,nan,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-04-13,Great value given the contents. I really only purchased as I needed a thermometer but was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the contents and have used most items. Definitely useful to have for a newborn,0
"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",Health Care,nan,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-02-17,"I think this set comes in extremely handy, you can pack it all away easy in the case it comes with so it‚Äôs very ideal for travelling and contains so many essentials for good quality and good price!",0
"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",Health Care,nan,1.0,United Kingdom,2020-03-01,"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. I cut my baby‚Äôs big toe trying to cut his nail and it bled for 20mins. The clippers are ridiculously sharp and even when I brushed my finger across them it felt sharp and dangerous. I would stick to biting his nails and threw the clippers in the bin!! The brush is ok and the thermometer took ages to get a reading, the nail file is useless - overall not happy at all and quite traumatised.",1
"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",Health Care,nan,4.0,United Kingdom,2020-03-09,"I bought this for the nasal sucker and I must say it is awful! Doesnt work at all, if this is your soul reason for purchase then I really wouldnt recommend; however, the rest of the products included are good hence the score. It's great its all in one bag so you can pop in changing back or suitcase when going away. Soft brushes and great nail scissors/ clippers",0
"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",Health Care,nan,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-01-16,Great little set for newborn baby; read some reviews that the brush bristles were hard?!

"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",Health Care,nan,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-07-06,Very handy to have. I have it with me all the time and it's a part of my babys changing/travel bag. It's a essential for every mum and the Tommy Tippie brand is the best one,0
"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",Health Care,nan,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-06-22,"This little pack comes with everything you need for a little one and is perfect, found it cheaper on amazon than in the local super market and is just what I was looking for üòä",0
"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",Health Care,nan,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-05-07,We like Tommee Tippen products so Decided to go with this brand. We purchased a no name brand before but it was cheap quality and not nice so returned it and kept the tommee tippee one.  üëçüèº Good quality and light easy pocket for traveling,0
"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",Health Care,nan,1.0,United Kingdom,2020-01-24,"Originally I thought this was a good product to get us started, however the constituent elements are not as good as if you bought them on their own. For example, the nasal aspirator was ineffective, and we have had to replace it, and the thermometer gives inaccurate readings, stuck at around 35.4 (which is hypothermic for a baby). Again, I have paid to replace this. In hindsight, I wouldn't buy a cheap all-in-one kit like this again.",0
"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",Health Care,nan,1.0,United Kingdom,2020-06-06,"This is very flimsy, poor quality Made is China stuff. scissors too bulky fir the tiny babies fingers, other pieces look more like a toy kit rather than something That can be used.",0

"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",Health Care,nan,1.0,United Kingdom,2019-12-18,"Awful quality, there's nothing in this set that can actually be used. I had to buy every single item separately. I'll give you a few reasons for not buying this product. 1. The nail clip blade is extremely sharp and presents some irregularities. I've tried to cut my newborn nails and just by touching it cut my baby's skin, haven't even pressed on it. Checking it on with my finger I have realised it's too sharp. 2. Baby brush and comb... seriously? Those are not suitable for delicate baby skin, the bristles are too strong. 3. Digital thermometer - that should be posed under baby's arm or mouth to give the temperature... that's a joke. First of all, baby is wriggling too much and it's impossible to keep the thermometer in position under arm for around 1 minute. Secondly, you can't make the baby keep the mouth shut for a better temperature measurement... otherwise, I've tested on my own mouth and was giving a result of 34deg Celsius which is impossible. 4. Nose cleaner - there are better products out there that can actually do the job. 5. Nail file - single use. 6. Teeth brush for newborn and baby? The brush has plastic bristles which are not suitable for baby that can chew and swallow. Unfortunately, I cannot return it as I bought this product long time in advance before the baby was born. But please make yourself a favour and avoid buying this.",0
"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",Health Care,nan,1.0,United Kingdom,2020-03-12,The most important item in this kit is the thermometer. My baby is poorly and I went to take his temperature and the thermometer is dead. The first time I come to use it and the battery dies. Really unacceptable given that I need to take his temperature in an emergency.,0
"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",Health Care,nan,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-02-28,"Great little kit, especially when you have a newborn with a cold. I love the small Emery boards to help keep those sharp little nails down. The only thing that I find fiddly is the thermometer which you have to hold in place for quite some time to get an accurate reading.",0
"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",Health Care,nan,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-05-22,Bought to get the thermometer as they were very difficult to get hold of at the time. Gave the rest to a friend who was expecting. She was very pleased.,0
"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",Health Care,nan,1.0,United Kingdom,2020-05-08,"Honestly just cheap and useless tat made solely to feel like a worried mum and dad to be are prepared. When push comes to shove and you need it with a newborn, this stuff is useless. There is place in hell reserved for whoever thought the thermometer would work for a wriggly newborn. Cheap tat. Avoid.",0

"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",Health Care,nan,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-06-27,"A great thing to have in the drawer for your newborn. It‚Äôs has everything you need any more to get you started.

I‚Äôm not thrilled with the thermometer, although it does get the job done. I think I will spend more on a better one in the future (more than what the whole kit costs).

The brush leaves my daughters hair lovely and the nail clippers work a treat.",0

"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",Health Care,nan,3.0,United Kingdom,2020-06-22,"Before having my son, I thought I  would use all the products but I didn't. I mostly use the nail clipper, comb, brush and emergy board. The thermometer is okay but I prefer the thermometer which goes in the ear as I think that gives the best results and I have noticed many doctors using thermometers that go in the ear as well. The Nasal Aspirator is way too big especially to use on a baby that is under 2 months. And the toothbrush is not soft at all. I think its better to buy individual products rather than the whole set.

"Boxclever Press Luxury A5 Diary Cover. Textured Cover with Zip for A5 Diaries & Journals. Untitled Diary Covers for Nurses, Health Care Professionals, Students or Home Use. (Seaspray)",Health Care,19.99,2.0,United Kingdom,2020-01-15,"Solid with stiff board inside and the faux leather material appears quite thick. The general construction and sewing appears very good. However the item is lacking in finesse. Velcro on small pocket not aligned, so does not hold closed. However this is academic since the  pocket is not of any use.! More important, the zip, although solid, is very rough making it-for me- unusable; it jams sometimes unless I am very careful and deliberate. It reminds me of zips from 40 years ago. There is binding next to the zip. Rather than using one piece, the manufacturers have continued with a join which is unsightly and has a black mark on it. Overall the fit is tight even with a 12 cm thick A5 notebook. with a 20 mm spiral wire spine, placed inside. Personally I would have prefered if it were 5-10 mm thicker.  I am disappointed, mainly because of the zip.",3

"NRS Healthcare M80282 Kura Care Easy Grip Children's Cutlery Set, Multi-Colour",Health Care,10.99,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-02-16,"Junior still can't hold a spoon at 2.5 years, has developmental delay and sensory issues amongst other things and always big issues around food generally. For some reason he uses finger and thumb to hold cutlery /really weak fist if we're lucky and ends up turning it upside down before it reaches his mouth (again for unknown reasons!) He also won't touch most food so we end up feeding him, but given his age he's been point blank refusing as he's craving control but just can't manage it. We've tried EVERYTHING...or so we thought!

The shape of this set has just meant he has managed to stab tomatoes and strawberries, scooped omelette and yoghurt and SOME MADE IT TO HIS MOUTH rather than his lap! We did iiiiiit!!!

Also arrived in a couple of days and the colours are appealing to children. The edges are curved so risk of injury is less, but the knife actually does cut and the fork is still pointed enough to actually get through food such as tomato skins, peppers etc.

We have had such stress around mealtimes recently and it sounds dramatic but it's honestly helped a situation that was starting to make the whole family miserable and dread mealtimes. Thank you so much!",3

"Oxbow Animal Health Critical Care, Herbivore, Apple-Banana Flavor, 141 Gram Bag",Health Care,nan,5.0,United States,2020-01-06,"Before moving to Florida from NY Ik bought this as a safe measure, just in case... well the whole way there I was extremely worried, he started to stop eating and acting weird, lethargic, panting, no interest, stoped pooping and peeing. I started to force feed him this. It was a little hard to mix up, and stayed a bit chunky. But other than that. The minute we arrived to my new apartment, we dropped everything off, and rushed him to the vet. It was a very big vet bill, and he had to stay over night. But the vet said that if it weren‚Äôt for this he would have already been dead. I owe it to this company, it saved his life. Definitely buy this to at least keep on hand, it‚Äôs hard to find in stores, and when you need it there‚Äôs nothing you can do, and things can go downhill very quickly.",0

Everyone rallied quickly after having this without any negative side effects. My vet recommended it. I keep it on hand in the freezer in case any foundlings come to the house. I think it's funny that the review asks you to rate the flavor, but the bearded dragon won't answer me when I ask him about that, so I just gave it 5/5. The cat begs for it, so that's a good sign. It smells like armpit, though.",0
"Oxbow Animal Health Critical Care, Herbivore, Apple-Banana Flavor, 141 Gram Bag",Health Care,nan,5.0,United States,2019-12-16,"My rabbit Chubbs had GI Stasis back in October and this helped bring him out of it. He ended up sick again with something else 3-4 weeks ago. The vet couldn‚Äôt figure out what was wrong. I went ahead and bought more of this and it kept him going. He has since passed, but I do recommend this product. It gives them what they need to help when they are sick. Still see a vet as medications can be required, but this will help with nutrition and getting water in them since you mix with water. I have a spare bag just in case our other rabbit ends up needing it. Chubbs did like the taste. He gobbled it up while he was sick last.",0

I read all the reviews and prayed it would work for me too... and it did!!!  I am 46 years old and in the worst part of menopause ...hot flashes , night sweats ...miserable !  Then... I start itching ...uncontrollably !  I‚Äôm single ... haven‚Äôt been intimate with anyone ...asking myself what the hell is happening down there?!?  Not just itching but also breaking out in acne ...down there!!  This has been going on for months!!  Can‚Äôt get into a doctor because of COVID-19....so I start researching and I find that ...all the symptoms of bacterial vaginosis appear to be what I‚Äôm experiencing.  I took the pill as soon as I got them in the mail...about 4pm in the afternoon.  I swear to the gods....by 9pm ...I wasn‚Äôt itching at all !  I felt more normal than I had in months !  I wanted to cry !  I‚Äôve been taking them for a week and it just keeps getting better everyday!  And the acne is going away as well!

My roommate said she'd been taking vaginal probiotics with great results (less yeast infections after her period, more lubrication, etc), but given I already take 50bil cfu probiotics for gut health, I thought it was hoopla. Until now.

Over the past several months, when I start sweating even a little, everything smells. I would walk from my car to work, and get a whiff of myself. After working out or running with friends, I'd be too embarassed to hang around. I could shower before bed, and still need to shower when I get up. I carried extra deo, underwear, and feminine wipes in my purse, gym bag, desk, work backpack. You get the idea. With summer here I was begrudgingly prepared to keep this routine. I'd talked to my gynecologist who had found nothing amiss.

3 days taking these, I noticed a difference, but didn't want to jinx it. 2 weeks in, and I have to say these have changed my life.

I‚Äôm almost done with this and I‚Äôm definitely buying more, I haven‚Äôt tried any other brand but why would I when this is doing so well! I even tried those vaginal soaps and washes, I do not need them anymore!! I was reluctant at first because of the price but if you‚Äôre frustrated like I was, it‚Äôs worth a shot!

My ph levels are so sensitive that even not using a panty liner will make everything imbalanced down there...Now, nothing is needed at all. No panty liner needed to stay fresh and everything goes back to normal on its own after sex after about a day.

I‚Äôve quit eating sugar. I‚Äôve done Keto and low carb and I even tried intermittent fasting. Nothing ever seemed to work. I‚Äôve tried a dozen different probiotics and I‚Äôve used digestive enzymes for years. I really wasn‚Äôt optimistic even though I read the reviews and was hopeful. This probiotic is a game changer.

I've had a 10 year long battle with depression and I have tried everything under the sun. Most things do not work. I've also tried other probiotics and I have not felt like this ever.

First - the product itself is fine but the oversized plastic container that houses the caplets was disgusting. Upon opening the container, it reeked of chemicals. The smell was so pungent that I rehoused the caplets in a spare glass bottle. I decided to go to our local health food store and buy the refrigerated version of this exact brand. Comes in nice glass bottle and it was the same price. After I use this product for three months - I‚Äôll edit my review with regards to its efficiency.ONE MONTH UPDATE: Upgraded my rating from a 3 to 5. I am extremely pleased with this product.

I've read reviews from you guys that said this helped well I was currently going through bv when I ordered and received this and its day 4 and it has not made a difference that I can tell. The doctor just keeps prescribing gel which helps and diflucan but it's back again the next month. Kinda not sure what to do at this point.

(All my paps were normal my whole life, I was checked out) So I assume that my goofed up cycle was contributing to my long bout of anxiety...and then my anxiety messed up my Ph levels, because I got a BAD and STUBBORN yeast infection. 4 days of diflucan at first, then it came back, or lingered for 2 weeks after. I went to P.Parenthood because, still had a discharge. She looked under the microscope,  YEAST. Miserable. She prescribed me a higher dose of diflucan that I took once every 4 days, instead of each day in a row. That did the trick.However, things still were not of normal smell down there, actually, it was a lack of smell. As if there was no good bacteria. Discharge was dry. I battled this thing for a month and a half. It was SO upsetting which of course made my mental health feel way worse. My husband is usually supportive but he was sick of hearing me complain. I was just done, so I found these. Took for a month straight. WOW. What a game changer. My mood was lifted a little bit, and everything back to normal down there.

"The 6-Minute Diary | Gratitude Journal for Men & Women, Mindfulness Journal | 6 Minutes a Day for more Self Care, Mental Health & Happiness",Health Care,nan,1.0,United Kingdom,2020-01-05,I persevered with this for a couple of months but found it really tricky to use. I couldn‚Äôt think of anything to write without being repetitive. I had to look online for positive affirmations after I‚Äôd constantly repeated the limited few I could think up myself. I am very grateful for many things in my life but I couldn‚Äôt think of enough to keep the diary interesting and repeated the same few things over and over again. Doing a good deed every day is tricky when you work alone most of the time so I had to put down daily jobs such as cooking dinner for me and my husband or walking the dogs. After about two months of repetitive writing I felt that the diary had provided me with absolutely no benefit at all. I prefer taking a walk with my dogs or spending time outdoors in my garden when the weather is good. That had a far better effect on my mind and sense of well-being. This may work for some people but I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it to anyone I know because my friends and family are quite similar to me and they wouldn‚Äôt know what to write.,6

Large portion of the diary is dedicated to talking about self improvement and is full of inspirational stories etc almost like a novel, this eats into paper which could have been used as actual diary space. I threw this out after a week of trying to use it. If I wanted a novel I'd have bought one. This doesn't fall under the category of diaries  - you'd be as well taking a piece of paper and writing three things you feel grateful for in the morning as that's really the only thing this offers (and you'd save yourself a heap of Money).",4

This diary has some reading at the beginning to explain how it works and evidence to back it up. You then begin with a little self assessment scoring everything from your overall mood to finances and relationships from 1 to 10. You will repeat this month by month and it‚Äôs a good way to see how you change.This is a very structured gratitude journal which makes it easy to do. Literally 3 mins in the morning and 3 mins in the evening. What you are grateful for, a positive affirmation in the morning and similar in the evening. There are weekly questions that really make you think.I loved this diary. It has changed my life for the better. It has a habit tracker and has helped me now also incorporate daily meditation into my life.I recommend this to anyone, struggling or not. For those of you who have read Rangan Chaterjee‚Äôs ‚Äúthe stress solution‚Äù, this diary helps you with most of the recommendations in the beginning of the book. You won‚Äôt regret getting it.",2
"The 6-Minute Diary | Gratitude Journal for Men & Women, Mindfulness Journal | 6 Minutes a Day for more Self Care, Mental Health & Happiness",Health Care,nan,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-02-03,"I bought this to go with a couple of books for my children (the 5 minute diary for the eldest and the 3 minute one for the younger child)... My initial objective was to get them to be grateful for their dinner... even if it's NOT chicken nuggets... be grateful you have food, you have warmth, you have comfort, even if the dinner had REAL chicken in it, as well as mushrooms!!! ... and that seemed to work, we got over that, not entirely of course, but a lesson has been learned (somewhat) in that department...
The unexpected by product of this experience however, is that THIS book grabbed my attention... it's not 'just' a gratitude journal which you write stuff down, it's the preamble, it's the all the information up front - the bit about why you're doing it in the first place...
That's what hooked me...
And then practicing the ritual with my daughters each day.
And at first, it was clutching at the obvious; grateful for food, water, clothes, warmth
But then something started to change, unexpectedly so... I started to dig deeper and feel more positive...
My gratitude now involves; realising my self worth and what I mean to my children, recognising what we have, not what we don't, grateful for opportunities and more meaningful, deeper reflection when it comes to positive affirmations....and one of my good deeds today, was simply 'Acceptance'... and 'Acceptance with grace'...
I love this book.
I have recommended and even bought copies for friends and colleagues...
I am more positive, more energised, more determined and dare I say happier in myself... I didn't even realise I needed changing, my days had been focused on other people and things and work and jobs which needed doing, that I forgot myself along the way. But I'm back now... and it feels great :)",2

"The 6-Minute Diary | Gratitude Journal for Men & Women, Mindfulness Journal | 6 Minutes a Day for more Self Care, Mental Health & Happiness",Health Care,nan,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-06-30,I decided to buy this after a very traumatic experience. My mental health was suffering and I felt I needed to focus on looking at the positive things. This has helped me so much. It doesn‚Äôt take much time so I don‚Äôt feel overwhelmed by it. It is good to journal things that have happened in more detail but focus on the little positive steps towards recovery as well as realising I have a lot to be grateful for. I have also used it as a daily focus for my 14 year old son but he does it verbally. It‚Äôs lovely to hear him talk about things he is grateful for. It has helped us both understand that even when life seems really tough there are things to be grateful for and great things still happen. It makes me think of the saying ‚ÄúEnjoy the little things because one day you will look back and realise that they were the big things‚Äù. I have found this so useful for the last six months that I have now bought the follow on version to continue for the next six months. I would recommend this to anyone who is struggling and perhaps may feel overwhelmed by having to write a lot each day. This is meant to only take 3 minutes in the morning and another 3 minutes at night but there is space to record longer thoughts at the end of each week and at the back of the planner. It‚Äôs really good.,1
"The 6-Minute Diary | Gratitude Journal for Men & Women, Mindfulness Journal | 6 Minutes a Day for more Self Care, Mental Health & Happiness",Health Care,nan,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-07-01,"I am absolutely hopeless with sticking to new things that are good for me long-term, whether it's eating healthily or exercising - but this is brilliant. It's such an easy habit to get into, as it requires minimal time input and no equipment (well, other than a pen). I mean, who doesn't have a few minutes each day?

When I first started using it, I found it incredibly difficult to think of good deeds for the day or good things that happened during the day, which says a lot in itself, but this makes me more aware of the good going on in life. I still struggle occasionally, but like the fact that this forces me to find the positive. It's making me noticeably more positive as time goes on and I've recommended it to lots of my friends and colleagues.

If you're on the fence about buying it, I'd ask 'what have you got to lose?'. I'm sure you've spent more on other potential 'fads' in the past, but this is a long-term investment, that doesn't go off or go to waste. Go for it!",2

This has helped a lot but often the negative thoughts far outweigh the good.

This diary has already helped me. I‚Äôve used it less than a week but the timing to write.. first thing in the morning and last thing at night give perfect opportunity to start and end the day better.
My old pattern was to remember the sad aspects too much.
I‚Äôm the kind of person that recognises things I‚Äôm grateful for often but then during a difficult day or hour, it‚Äôs all too easy to push my feelings of great fullness to the back of my mind. Therefore the negative thoughts take over.

Do read all the pages before starting to write the diary. They are incredibly helpful to understand why you should write and ideas of what will be helpful to write.

I‚Äôm also incredibly interested in psychology and this ticked my box for personal interest too, as well as helping me personally.",1

For years now I‚Äôve known that there‚Äôs great value in self reflection and gratitude, but just couldn‚Äôt find a way to fit this into my daily/weekly routine without it feeling like really hard work. Until I bought this journal. I love the way this book breaks down the various elements into small chunks and makes it interesting and easy to do.  I actually look forward to filling it in every day, and the accompanying information gives you great insight as to why you‚Äôre doing it. It‚Äôs not the cheapest option, but I think this stands head and shoulders above the rest.",0

This book has helped me break habits I had been carrying around for years and has also helped me to create new healthier habits. I have struggled with depression for years and even after finally getting a hold on it I still could not let go of negative thinking and behaviour. This book has provided me with the tools I needed to maintain a healthier and truly happier life. I cannot recommend this journal enough.,0

Gorgeously covered with linen. It's easy to use and literally takes 6 minutes to use. It may seem expensive but it's worth it. At the beginning of the book are some 60 plus pages of information, tips and uplifting quotes. I will definitely be buying another one",0

It has a significant reading 'buy in' to begin with that of course can be optional. This buy in covers some of the science behind gratitude and useful tips and tricks to implement it into your life.
My gratitude has improved and this noticeably permeated into my everyday life.
The weekly questions are fantastic and provoke introspection yet only take a few minute to complete.
I have just bought the follow up '6MD pure' and I look forward to using it daily.

For those worrying about the price, how much are you willing to pay for a proven method to improve your happiness for 6 minutes of input a day + an extra 5 minutes for questions once a week.",0

I definitely see this item working for only a particular type of person. I would not call myself lazy but I found the repetitive questions everyday kinda hard and boring to answer but I am writing this during quarantine where I am self-isolating at home so it will try to use it again after I go back to work. There are a good few quotes and explanations at the start that was kinda repetitive and I did not finish reading them but I can say that the exercise itself did out me in a positive mood instantly. maybe a bit too expensive for the book.,0

Recently had ankle surgery which has left me immobile for 6 weeks which had massively affected my mindset and mood. Got back to work today and was in such a great mood after decided today would be a brill day to start - why wait til New Year?!

I absolutely love this so far! There is a very lengthy intro to the book but it is full of information for you to get the most out of using this diary.
I'm certain it will be easy to stick to as the daily inputs are brief - but get you thinking.

The book itself is stunning - pages are thick which will be ideal for the entries. Very stury design.

The best recommendation I can give is that I have bought the follow up Pure. Like the daily quotes and the gratitude practice really makes a difference to not taking things for granted which can so easily be the case with our natural tendency for hedonic adaptation.One bit of feedback would be to include some more real life examples if possible for people just starting out so they can ease into things. Certainly took me longer than 3mins for the morning routine in the beginning which slightly hinders habit formation. I got there in the end and everyone will find what works for them from using this journal and tutorial bit at the start. Enjoy! X",0

I have never before managed to stick with a journal, but this one asks the important questions and I actually looked forward to completing it each morning and evening.

I found being prompted to think in this way very jarring at first. It's completely contrary to how my brain works, which is why I need it. It's very simple to do and not too full of the usual self help tropes that catch in my cynical throat. I wish I'd discovered this earlier, the effect was instant and is becoming stronger with practice. I haven't missed a day yet and it has never felt like a chore.",1

"The 6-Minute Diary | Gratitude Journal for Men & Women, Mindfulness Journal | 6 Minutes a Day for more Self Care, Mental Health & Happiness",Health Care,nan,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-01-03,"I love this diary/journal. I used the first version for 6 months and have now started on the Pure edition. This takes your thinking to the next level. There are suggested guidelines, but really it's up to you to decide what you want to focus on, in terms of Gratitude in your day. In a busy world, where time is of the essence, to sit down in the morning with a cuppa and consider what/who you are greatful for is a positive way to start the day. Similarly to reflect in the evening brings everything together. I was reviewing my first journal and it brought back happy memories of the small things that made me smile, in a big life that sometimes doesn't. I've found this process invaluable for my postive mental health. Highly recommended.",0

I‚Äôm not really one for self-help so when I was given it as a birthday gift, I smiled and said thanks and forgot about it for nearly 6 months. Then I had a mental health breakdown. I found the diary by accident and decided to try. The guidance at the beginning really resonated but for the first week I found it really hard. The hardest part was the affirmation- not my thing at all. To tackle this, I chose to find a daily affirmation on Instagram that spoke to me that day.Six months on and I‚Äôm the happiest and most at peace than I‚Äôve ever been.

It forces you to reflect, think about what you want, what are you unhappy about, what you can change, etc. - it's a great start to 2020 and I enjoy doing it morning and night.  The only thing I can recommend that they change is the ink colour/font, the ink is just too pale on grey paper and the font could be a bit bigger, maybe 11 pitch.

I gave myself a week to read through the introduction and familiarise myself with how I should be using this day and night, I am not great at expressing myself so this was great assistance.

I love the great quotes and the variety of questions it asks you each week. It reduces the repetitive feeling each day.

I have been using the product for roughly three weeks now and am pretty sure I will buy another one once the six months are up.

Only thing I can complain about is where do I put my pen?

"The 6-Minute Diary | Gratitude Journal for Men & Women, Mindfulness Journal | 6 Minutes a Day for more Self Care, Mental Health & Happiness",Health Care,nan,5.0,United States,2020-01-24,"Having just completed using the 5 Minute Journal for the past six months, I was looking for an alternative to carry on this great practice I developed. I landed on this book, The 6 Minute Diary.

First, I will say that I am completely surprised that the authors were able to publish this book because of its similarities to the 5 Minute Journal. The introduction section is nearly identical, but it was a good refresher.

The differences: I absolutely love the monthly habit trackers. The 5 Minute Journal doesn‚Äôt have these and it‚Äôs a nice addition. Additionally, there is a space to capture weekly notes. I love having extra space to jot down highlights throughout the week.

This book was an easy transition from the 5 Minute Journal with a few extra bonuses.

These books have absolutely changed my life. My husband commented that I wake up in a better mood and I‚Äôve noticed I have developed a more positive and grateful outlook on life.

If you decide to purchase it, I hope it brings you as much joy as it does for me!",22

I was nervous about getting something like this for myself because I‚Äôm not used to journaling everyday but I found the prompts short and easy to incorporate in my daily routine. It really does take 6 minutes each day (3 in the am, 3 in the pm). I do however worry that I will get tired of the same 6 daily propers after a few months, but overall I think they are great ways for me to express gratitude, start on a positive note, and mentally organize my day. My favorite things about the daily are the weekly prompts and the reading section at the beginning. The Diary starts with evidence based research that shows why adding this to your daily routine helps. I loved that it answered a lot of my questions and worries about being able to keep up with the journal and gave me helpful tips for starting new and healthier habits such as journaling. The weekly prompts also help break up the daily routine by fostering reflection. They change week to week which is really nice. I also like the weekly challenges - a great way to add some positivity or new things in your week. I highly recommend this diary.

"Listerine Total Care Mouthwash, 600 ml",Health Care,nan,1.0,United Kingdom,2020-07-23,"I know the product has got a lot of good reviews which is why I decided to try it. I‚Äôve used Listerine for years but different ones mostly either citrus, original or mild mint. I‚Äôve never had any problems with any of them until now.  My mouth isn‚Äôt usually sensitive to things but I found this far too strong to such an extent it left me with a very sore mouth which even after stopping use is still sore especially y tongue and roof of my mouth.  I‚Äôd suggest if our mouth is the least but sensitive then avoid it.",21
"Listerine Total Care Mouthwash, 600 ml",Health Care,nan,3.0,United Kingdom,2019-12-04,"Although the taste of this mouthwash is great, I feel that it's too strong and harsh. My gums, lips and tongue always feel raw after using this and it often results in skin peeling off my inner lip.

It leaves my teeth clean and breath fresh but the side effects are not worth it. It may be as it has alcohol in it which is contributing to the dry mouth. I don't have a sensitive mouth or teeth so I am attributing this to the mouthwash.

I haven't experienced whitening at all since use.

Personally not for me.",13

It also fits nicely around the bed and chair.Perfect size and not to small and not too big.  This is recommended,3
"NRS Healthcare M15691 Portable Overbed/Chair Table - Tilting, Adjustable and Wheeled",Health Care,nan,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-05-02,"Im finally organised! Wish I‚Äôd got this 6 weeks ago....

Working from home during Lockdown (office on the bed LOL) it‚Äôs taken me ages setting up / breaking down my kit everyday, but not anymore!

It only took a few minutes to assemble, without needing any tools. The A4 instruction sheet is in large readable text, using step-by-step notes & photos.

One niggle about the instruction sheet - the bars supporting the table top have 2 retractable buttons holding them in place, not one as shown in the photos & notes!

I set up my Surface Pro laptop, an external hard drive, desk fan, reading light AND I still have space on the table top to use my mouse!

Being right-handed, my laptop is on the left hand side of the table, with the fulcrum point (law of physics) furthest away - so you get ‚Äúbounce‚Äù when typing - not enough to be an issue, but when doing long reports or letters, it might make me move the laptop over to the right side / lessen the distance to the down supports = less bounce!

The surface is sealed / wipe clean (not sure why other reviews mention a papery surface?)

The table top is side-edged with a black plastic shielding which doesn‚Äôt sit very ‚Äòproud‚Äô of the surface - maybe 1mm or 2mm - meaning mouse control / typing is still comfortable while resting your arms across the edge.... but the ridge isn‚Äôt high enough to stop items sliding off, especially if you‚Äòre using the table top at a slightly tilted angle - perfect for my use, but might be an issue for people wanting the table top to retain items / stop pens rolling off!

Tilting the top to an angle takes a couple of seconds & fixes firmly in place - again perfect for my use (mouse control / typing / reading)

Still can‚Äôt believe the value for money on this purchase - sturdy, robust, easy to manoeuvre and a large working area!

Absolutely love it!!",12

So I researched and came across this product.

I have been taking it for about 6 months now.

I won't be seeing my eye specialist for another 6 months, so I will find out then what difference there is in my sight and eye tests by taking these for a year will have made.

However, in the meantime I have definitely noticed a few things:

1. I have had very dry eyes for a few decades now. I have Sjogrens Syndrome. Even eyedrops didn't work well, no matter how many I used, or what make I used. These capsules have improved my dry eyes a lot, to the extent that I can feel the benefit now when I use eyedrops. I still have dry eyes, but they are made comfortable now with eyedrops. Before taking these capsules my eyes were agonisingly dry and stuck together at night and felt like sandpaper rubbing together. But those horrible sensations have now gone. This is after 6 months of taking these capsules.

2. I was having difficulty with driving this time of year when the early morning and later afternoon sun is low in the sky. This sun blinded me. In the end I avoided those times of day this time of year.
Not any more. I was driving into blinding early morning sun, for an important appointment. I was going to go a different route when I suddenly realised I wasn't being blinded by this sun. . It was still very bright with those rays, but I wasn't being blinded by it. I have been out more days with this low sun, and my eyes are fine with it now.

3. Another thing, my night time vision has improved as well. I had stopped driving at night. But I found myself driving back, the other day, in the dark because everything over ran. Then I realised the oncoming headlights were not blinding me any more.

4. I also had found tunnels hard to drive through because I couldn't see well in them. So I would take a very long route to avoid river tunnels. But I found myself driving through a tunnel because I couldn't face the long route that day. Suddenly I realised (it was the same tunnel as previously), that the light didn't seem dim any more. Also in my back garden (I watch the stars in the night sky), I found that I could see in the dark much better.

So with taking these eye capsules for the last 6 months, I have noticed an improvement in the 4 things above.

I will continue to take these capsules always.

If, after research you decide these capsules could help, then I would say give them a go. It has taken me 6 months taking them daily that has got me to this point of improvement.

When I see my eye specialist next, I will come back and report what my eye specialist says. He said that some things would get worse in my eyes, that it was a natural progression. I am hoping that in 6 months time that my eyes will be no worse than when he tested them 6 months ago. That is my hope.

*****

UPDATE August 2021
I said I would come back when I had seen the specialist again. But Covid-19 and lockdowns got in the way, and the eye hospital was not seeing patients.

I continued taking these capsules and recently I saw my hospital eye specialist again (they were seeing patients again). My eyes are continuing to do well. They are not getting worse like the specialist said they would. My specialist is pleased with my progress.

I am very pleased with these capsules.

Also because of Covid-19 and the lockdown, the NHS retinopathy team in Wales were not monitoring patients. I should have had their eye checks because of my diabetes but they were not doing them. However, recently, just before my hospital eye appointment my opticians offered a similar test to check my eyes. I decided to pay for it. My optician showed me the results, and he said to carry on whatever I was doing because it was working for my eyes. My eyes were improved and I had stopped the natural progression my hospital specialist said was inevitable.

I shall continue with these capsules.

Thank you

I've now used the Reflect version of this cushion in my office for over 3-years for around 9 hours every weekday.

I'm at the upper end of the suggested weight limit, which is maybe why the cushion has now lost some of its bounce. So, I've just replaced it with a new one. It's an expensive outlay, but working out its cost per year I think its a good investment.

Apart from the reduced support/bounce, the old one has worn really well with no sign of tears or stitching coming apart.",4

"Wright's Traditional Coal Tar Soap 002629, 500 gram, Pack of 4",Health Care,4.24,4.0,United Kingdom,2020-04-20,"I procured a pack of these heading into the CV19 era as a backup, thinking that there would come a time when, bereft of all liquid soap, all fragrant latherings, we would be forced to turn native, to return to the scent of coal tar soap....

I had to turn to it sooner than I ever expected..... The increased washing with the Blue scented liquid soap did no favours to my delicate digits. Dryness and itchiness setting in irrespective of how much Scandinavian hand cream I applied twixt scrubbing.

I started on the Wright's and immediately knew the Right choice had been made...

I was catapulted back to childhood days....that smell...it lingers....and I remember

No more dryness, no more itchy prickly pinkies....just a dab of hand cream and life is good...

However......the department of infernal affairs, (she who must be listened to..)..despises the smell....but I've been allowed to keep my bar of Wright's in a sealed box, by the sink. ...for now...

Being at home on my own part of the day, and on two crutches, I would not have been able to take my lunch and cuppas from the kitchen to the lounge without this trolley.  The trolley is very sturdy and I like the fact that the handles slope toward you.  The trays are strong and wipe easily.  There are no brakes, which wasn't a problem for me, but I would say that this may be a safety issue for anyone who is very infirm and unsteady on their feet.

From Day-timer to Franklin Covey, and Tony Robbins to Michael Hyatt, and from the other weekly and daily planners, I've used them all.  This one is not your typical tasks and appointments or other renditions. This planner actually helps you to translate your goals into reality, by first writing your goals, and then linking them to a monthly plan, weekly actions, and daily agenda!!  This is the planner I've been waiting for my whole life!!  (No joke - I know that may sounds extreme, but it's true!)  All thumbs up on this one!  You won't be disappointed!  Love, love, love it!  More than five stars!!

The layout isnt smooth and transitional from one point to the next. Lots of flipping back and forth. However, once I took it apart and rearranged the order of pages to coincide weeks with appropriate months and a few other changes in order, it was a much smoother use. TBH its just as cost effective to create your own journal using an app, as I find many productivity journals take longer and are more frustraing than the literal hundreds of ones Ive put together for myself over 20 years.",2

This notebook did just that and more. The planner is set up to not only help you stay accountable to your goals but you actually figure out in detail what your goal/s actually are. This was a huge lesson for me because I realized that I did not have a very specific goal with a timeline so my efforts were not super focused and they definitely were not tracked like they are now.  I really like the check-boxes and habit card. They are probably my favorite part of the planner. They help me look at each day and see how well or how bad I did and then adjust the next day.I'll be ordering more of these very soon.Thanks for this wonderful product!!,3

"Leucillin Natural Antiseptic Spray | Antibacterial, Antifungal & Antiviral | for Dogs, Cats and All Animals | for Itchy Skin and All Skin Care Health | 500ml",Health Care,nan,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-06-26,Leucillin really works on animals AND on humans! I noticed two days ago my horse had a runny eyes due to the flies and she is prone to get conjunctivitis (last year the cream the vet gave me for this was very expensive). So I sprayed this a few times in her eyes and by the next day the running had stopped and the eye was clear again. It really doesn't sting your eyes (my mare didn't mind it one bit)  - I have used it in my own eyes as it is safe for humans too. My partner got an insect bite today which really stung but as soon as he sprayed this on it the itchiness disappeared and it has almost cleared up now (a few hours later). My friend's horse had a horse fly bite yesterday and I brought out this trusty purple spray - the area is fine now and there is no swelling. I also use it also on my gelding's feathers to ward off feather mites and summer itching. It has really helped and there is very little foot stomping now. So I highly recommend this very versatile and effective spray that will benefit you in so many ways :),3

I have long hair and creams were difficult to apply and made a mess. I apply after washing my hair and leave to dry; it keeps the eczema under control. The eczema does come back as per a lot of eczema but it always quickly clears it. I've used it recently on a weird itchy rash on the back of my hand and it took the nasty redness and heat out of it overnight.Currently treating my husband's conjunctivitis with it and it appears to be working on that as well.I realise we sound like a right pair üòÜWe do use it on the pets and it helps wounds heal quickly. Completely cures hotspots on my friend's labradoodle in just 24 hours. Magic stuff!,17

High recommend",10

Bought it on basis of so many positive reviews cross-referenced with several scholarly articles. It is a chemical that our own cells produce in the immune reaction, although obviously in tiny volumes, and was used in WW1 on wards. Problem has been producing it in a stable form, it used to have to be generated on-site, but recent advances have come up with solutions with shelf-lives of a year or so.In anti SARS-CoV-2 sense we use it for misting items we‚Äôve brought back from the shops, for disinfecting surfaces, spraying down our outside gear etc. But we‚Äôve also found it seems to have given our cockatiel some relief from self-plucking of his shoulder feathers. Just like all the dog and cat-owners have said he doesn‚Äôt flinch or seem to experience any discomfort whatsoever and just seems to be calmer and more comfortable. We sprayed it on ourselves first to test, no sting, just a slight tang of swimming pool. Great product.",3

It was really bad but the spray did help! Now however she is averse to spray bottles so thought she was being reprimanded and purposefully irritated so she became rather depressed. Also after using this on my blisters IT STUNG LIKE HELL! so I don't know maybe it actually hurts alot! And Though her skin infection healed she would still lick at it before it could fully recover. I then switched to HomeoPet Hotspot medicine and put it in her meals for two months straight and the skin and fur returned and she's been well ever since. The spray works well and is good for human and pet emergencies but becareful if your pet might be afraid. Also after she was depressed a Kong kickaroo and thrive cat treats cheered her up!,1

I find that there is very little or no 'scent', or if there was it didn't last very long at all. It does not take a lot of spray to enable you to cover both hands, and dries very quickly.

If you use a Sharpie you get bleed through on the pages. So I glued some together with Prit-type-stick but they came open again. The closing elastic dislodged upon opening & Gorilla glue didn't work to secure it back in place...urgh.I think these planners are good for replacing an annual diary with the habbit trackers etc but you can't fit much on the pages as it's smaller than A5.  I don't think bullet journals are for me personally as the dots make me a bit dizzy. I thought I'd give it a go though to make more feel more organised but after 2 months I've found I'm writing more in my annual diary & on my iphone notes. Have skipped most of February already.  I've come back to it but prefer my week - to - view diary. I think this has taught me a valuable lesson though to go back to a day - to - view- dairy next year.",6

The fact it isn‚Äôt bulky is perfect. The only things that you need to consider are it takes ages to write all the dates in and the calendar starts on Sunday and the diary part on Monday. If the design team could pair up with the diary starting the week on Monday for consistency and print a version at the start of January already dated it would be absolutely perfect. Even with those two issues I will still be buying more  as I want to be sure I always have this diary.",1

It‚Äôs very good quality and the inside is not only very pretty but very organised! It also comes with a few stickers.

Due to the current situation we are in, I found that I didn‚Äôt need so much space as I have been using in my current planner so I decided to order the GG planner and start in April.

I like the fact the month calender has not been rotated to fit one page but fits onto two pages with lines around it for little notes. It's not too big or too small.The only thing bad about it, which tbh is more bad about me lol, is room for human error, I wanted the A5 and not the smaller version, the A5 seems to be only undated in rose gold, and if you're like me and prone to making mistakes, you spend time filling in the days and dates and then get them wrong and having to make ugly scribbles to correct them and not want to use it anymore",5

Only problem is the weekly diary page starts on a Monday but the monthly section starts on a Sunday, when I have shared dates from weekly to monthly I have put them in the wrong column as they don't correspond so it's a bit confusing/frustrating; and it doesn't feel or look nice (in something motivational) when you have to cross things out to put the information in the correct column.

I LOVE the behaviour trackers as well, so good for me, personally, to be able to see what I‚Äôm doing (or not doing) visually to try and monitor my behaviours.Three weeks in to January I already feel like I‚Äôve achieved so much - and now I can see exactly what I‚Äôve achieved when I look back over the weeks.PLUS, it‚Äôs SUPER cute and I love the built in pen holder, such a nifty idea that I wish more planners had.

In my case, I never did.I wanted something to simply log some simple workouts and food details but found this diary so cram packed I completely lost motivation to even start and ended up buying another much simpler work out / nutrition diary.

The paper is great quality too and so far I've not had any problems with bleed through.,0

Undated ‚Äì Start Anytime, Lasts 1 Year ‚Äì Rose Gold",Health Care,12.99,5.0,United States,2020-07-02,"I received this planner yesterday and was so eager to try it out, I opened it immediately! The color was great, it had 3 different color page placers, a spot to hold your pen, a little pocket in the very back that had stickers, in the front it has several pages for you to write down your goals and on each month page it has spots so that you can update your goals and the quality seemed pretty great.
Unfortunately this specific planner is not going to work for me. The dates had to be filled in by hand which isn't horrible except for the months where there are '6' weeks so to speak. There are only 5 weeks worth of blocks so some months didn't fit all the way. For me personally, I want my full months available instead of having to flip the page for the remainder of the month.
Also, I did not realize it, but there was no additional pages for ""notes"". Instead it has dotted pages in the back. For some that may be great but for me, I will not use it and prefer to have the note pages.
The last thing that I found wouldn't work for me was the size. This was a fail on my part as the listing gives you the dimensions of the planner, however, I didnt realize that the spaces to write in would be as small as they were. Again, that was a judgment fail on my part since this is a tablet sized planner. After having this is realized that I need a full (bigger) size option.
Before even receiving the planner I received a message from the seller thanking me for my purchase and stating that they have a 60 day money back guarantee if you dont absolutely love it and to please reach out with any issues. So I reached out and expressed my minor issues. I received a response very quickly offering a replacement (one that has the dates already filled in) or a full no hassle refund. Unfortunately I declined the replacement since it was only able to correct 1 of the 3 flaws. They issued a refund immediately after my decline and even told me not to worry about returning the original. The customer service with this company was phenomenal!!! Even though it did not work for me, I still give this product 5 stars.",0

I have adapted this planner to my needs. It's awesome that it has a weekly view so I can see all my to-dos and my plans in one glance. The only caveat I would say to buyers here is be sure to click the size you want - I accidentally clicked the smaller size and had to re-order later. I like the larger option so I can fit more in.

The pages are very thick and sturdy which is great and you can get creative using washi tape or colored markers because the pages are white with dark gray font.

I have tried bullet journal style planning for a couple of years now, and I always fall behind because it takes a lot of time to draw out the pages for the upcoming week. I love how this planner has a monthly and a weekly spread, but they are blank so you can fill in the dates yourself (which is really helpful to me because there are some weeks I just don't think to plan, and I don't feel like I am wasting any paper since I can just use the next page, even if it's a couple weeks down the road.) I am happy that the second page of each week has a few helpful trackers, for the week's priorities, a to-do list, and a habit tracker, and below that, it has BULLET JOURNAL space on the lower half of the page. So I can put my own things down. At the back, there are quite a few pages of bullet journal space as well, so I have a perfect mix of being able to do big things in the BuJo pages, but not have to draw out a schedule from scratch each week. I also love that there are THREE bookmarks attached so you can keep one in each section of the planner.I will say, the one thing that I wish is that there were a couple different options to choose from with the layout of the weekly spread. I would personally like the dates to go across the top of the two page spread, rather on the first page, and then have the trackers and BuJo space underneath, also going across both pages.",1

You can use stickers or inspirational things to make it fun
Habit tracker is GREAT
Helps maintain goals
Thick paper

Cons:
There are too many placeholder ribbons
A bit pricey
The months and weeks are separate rather than there being a month followed by weeks, another month followed by weeks...it creates a bit of flipping back and forth",0

Two courses of antibiotics didn‚Äôt help at all. I‚Äôd post some before and after pics but nobody wants to see that. Pretty horrific 4 inch open wound. Bought this in desperation and, within 3 days, the wound was clearing up beautifully. With the aid of a lampshade collar, and 3 good doses of this a day, plus some gentle cleaning with cotton wool pads I realise I could have cared for her perfectly well myself for about ¬£20. This stuff is easy to apply and doesn‚Äôt distress her at all. Looks to be doing exactly what it promises - kill bacteria and promote healing without pain. Will keep an emergency supply.

I used it that night and the next day his feet were around 80% better! I was shocked and absolutely amazed.

Not even 6 hours after the grass being cut they had both started to scratch and chew their paws.

I have tried many many creams and spray over the years, including various (expensive) treatments from the vet and even the use of steroids for one of them as she had got so bad she was going bald with all her itching!

My male had managed to scratch a horrible sore onto his stomach area, I had tried treating it with another well- known dog anti itch brand for several days with no luck what so ever and figured it was going to have to be another vet trip before the cut turned into a full-blown wound and would get infected. I had seen this spray advertised several times but to be honest, I just assumed it would be the same as all the others I already have sitting in the cupboard which didn't work for us. However, when telling a friend I was going to have to take him back to the vet she recommended trying Leucillin Antiseptic Skin Care Spray and told me her vet uses it and that she had had great results too so decided it was worth a go.

Item arrived really quickly and spraying it onto the cut didn't seem to bother him at all. Within a day the sore had already started to look better. Even better my dog was no longer scratching at the area or trying to constantly lick it. Have used the spray for 3 days (twice a day although it does recommend 3 times) and today the area has completely healed and no longer red or sore. My other Maltese hasn't been as bad (so far) this year however she has been chewing at her paws a bit. I have given her feet a quick spray once a day and that alone seems to be enough to stop her biting and causing more harm.

Am truly amazed by how well it has worked, although have to say I'm a little annoyed I didn't purchase it sooner as I would have saved the dogs many summers of itching misery and myself many large vet bills!",3

"The 6-Minute Diary Pure | Gratitude Journal, Mindfulness Journal for Men & Women | 6 Minutes a Day for more Mental Health, Happiness & Self Care",Health Care,nan,5.0,United Kingdom,2019-12-26,"I absolutely love this product.  I started with the Six Minute Diary but was rather half-hearted about it - thinking it couldn't possibly be just six minutes a day... but it arrived and I filled it in that day ... and the next day... and the next day...I loved the daily quotes/affirmations;  I loved the fact that the statements/questions are simple and straightforward and didn't make it feel like an exam or that there was a ""wrong answer"".  I just love it.So much that as I filled it in one day.. then the next... then the next... I came to the end of it.  I was delighted and disappointed all at the same time... so I immediately ordered the Six Minute Diary Plus... and am very much looking to not only continuing my morning and evening ""journalling"" (which has improved my focus on my life, my goals, what I will accept and what is unacceptable to me) and I have high hopes that ""Plus"" will allow me to continue to start and end each day in a positive, productive, pro-active mindset - which has had a massive beneficial impact on so many other aspects of my life.I'm going to end here because I know I'm beginning to sound evangelical about it... but I really can't recommend it highly enough.  Buy it and tell yourself ""I'll give it my best shot for a week""... don't look at the whole book and think I'll never get to the end... just tell yourself ""seven days"".  That's what I did... but the first seven days were followed by the second seven days.. then the third ... and the fourth... and ... on those days where I couldn't fill it in first thing (with a cup of coffee in bed) ... I missed it.  My day didn't ""start right""... and on those rare occasions where I couldn't end my day positively reflecting on all the good things that had happened... I went to sleep with my heart that little bit less content .. and I couldn't hear my soul singing the lullaby that the diary created every evening.Buy it.  Try it.  I hope, like me, you'll love it.",4
"The 6-Minute Diary Pure | Gratitude Journal, Mindfulness Journal for Men & Women | 6 Minutes a Day for more Mental Health, Happiness & Self Care",Health Care,nan,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-01-29,"I bought this to go with a couple of books for my children (the 5 minute diary for the eldest and the 3 minute one for the younger child)... My initial objective was to get them to be grateful for their dinner... even if it's NOT chicken nuggets... be grateful you have food, you have warmth, you have comfort, even if the dinner had REAL chicken in it, as well as mushrooms!!! ... and that seemed to work, we got over that, not entirely of course, but a lesson has been learned (somewhat) in that department...
The unexpected by product of this experience however, is that THIS book grabbed my attention... it's not 'just' a gratitude journal which you write stuff down, it's the preamble, it's the all the information up front - the bit about why you're doing it in the first place...
That's what hooked me...
And then practicing the ritual with my daughters each day.
And at first, it was clutching at the obvious; grateful for food, water, clothes, warmth
But then something started to change, unexpectedly so... I started to dig deeper and feel more positive...
My gratitude now involves; realising my self worth and what I mean to my children, recognising what we have, not what we don't, grateful for opportunities and more meaningful, deeper reflection when it comes to positive affirmations....and one of my good deeds today, was simply 'Acceptance'... and 'Acceptance with grace'...
I love this book.
I have recommended and even bought copies for friends and colleagues...
I am more positive, more energised, more determined and dare I say happier in myself... I didn't even realise I needed changing, my days had been focused on other people and things and work and jobs which needed doing, that I forgot myself along the way. But I'm back now... and it feels great :)",13

"The 6-Minute Diary Pure | Gratitude Journal, Mindfulness Journal for Men & Women | 6 Minutes a Day for more Mental Health, Happiness & Self Care",Health Care,nan,4.0,United Kingdom,2020-04-25,"I got a lot out of the first volume of The 6-Minute Diary.  It helped me, a natural pessimist, to take stock of and appreciate the good things in life just by asking me a few simple (and yes, repetitive) questions every single day, with a weekly set of deeper questions that ultimately helped me think about what was important in life to me.  This second volume is useful for keeping that positivity and gratitude going. I gave it only 4 stars because the weekly reflection, which I used to find sometimes challenging but definitely enlightening, has been replaced by a 'lighter' version, although I can see that it is still useful. Overall I have found that creating the habit of thinking about the positives in life, however small, has been really beneficial for me.",0

"The 6-Minute Diary Pure | Gratitude Journal, Mindfulness Journal for Men & Women | 6 Minutes a Day for more Mental Health, Happiness & Self Care",Health Care,nan,5.0,United Kingdom,2020-01-28,"I have had the 6 minute diary twice now, also my husband has brought one choosing it over other journals. I use the second section as my top things I need to focus on to achieve for the day.  The gratitude, positive affirmation, deeds of the day, improvements and experiences are all areas that make you think about self improvement and focus on positivity which helps overall with mental health and life choices.  The journal's quotes and habit tracking has helped me with my anxiety and getting me back on track to normality. There are a few other journals on the market but this one has helped me the most.",0
