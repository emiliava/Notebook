What happens 6 months from now when they are no longer buying and I am, so I deserve the usual old price and not some overpriced item caused by the panic squad with more money than sense.Please rebate for those of us not causing the panicking and not liable for price increases like this.\\n',\n",
       " 'I never thought that I still need to read any reviews when I was buying this Andrex toilet paper that I have been used for many years.\\n\\nJust like others bad comments and photo upload, the size of this Andrex toilet paper is extremely small and thin. Although the price is cheaper with discount, but it is not worth to buy at all. Please order and buy at local store if you could, as the quality and quantity will much more better than this one.\\n\\nI generally don’t give bad review, but I really feel disappointed about this purchase. This one star just want to thanks to the delivery driver for his hard work in this Covid-19 epidemic, and also want to appreaciate them for sending me the daily necessities that I need in this lockdown.',\n",
       " \"\\n  We brought Andrex multi on a few occasions, and have previously thought how great they are, saving worries of running out of loo roll and bulk of shopping to carry. We received our latest order few days ago and the size of the rolls appears to be at least 30% less! Really can't be bothered sending them back, but will not by from here again - this shortfall was not just found in the muti pack, also the single 9 roles are the same size. (We tagged a single 9 to the order for comparison reasons) Actually, it would appear that Amazon have split a multi pack, as each roll in the standard 9 pack was the same as the ones in the Muti 45 pack (5x9).I've only just realised this as i write.\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n  Disappointed in these thinned out, less dense loo roll. Not like the Andrex loo roll stocked in store. These just be ones sent out online! It’s feels like Andrex are trying to pull a fast one by reducing the quantity and quality and hoping customers won’t complain or won’t notice. Since we’re in a loo roll crisis amidst toilet roll hoarding we shan’t be returning these but I’ll never buy Andrex again on principle!Loo-sers!\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n  This product sums up the pitfalls of buying from Amazon. You would naturally expect Andrex toilet rolls to be the same as the ones in the supermarket but these are more like a cheap roll that you buy in a budget shop; smaller than the standard roll, thin, not very soft, and the classic scam - the larger diameter centre (so less paper).  These are either fake or a scam deal arranged between Andrex and Amazon, either way it's a rip-off.\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n  I picked these up as there was a great offer on, when we usually buy another type of Andrex roll. These were great value for money, but when they arrived I realised why... They’re too thin, which my wife has only pointed out about a thousand times since. These are 2-ply, rather than 3, which I should have noticed before ordering.\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n  Don't buy thinking its the usual Andrex rolls you get from the supermarket. It looks more like a rebranded cheap supermarket own brand toilet roll. It has been supersize down. One normal size would equal 2 of these. Be warned.\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n  Warning these are very small toilet rolls, not full size, this is not a good deal if you look at the difference in size between it and ordinary toilet roll.

It is\\nnot what it says on the packaging. It says 103mm. When i measured it, it was 100mm. The seller will refuse to pay for your return costs.

Whoever came up with that idea - please get a different job.The rolls don't seem to include any recycled paper. That's excellent! Bleaching old paper to make it white and attempting to remove inks can create dioxins - VERY bad for the environment and your sensitive areas. (Recycled paper is a great idea but ONLY for cardboard.\\n\",\n",

So although the costco ones worked out around £2 more expensive, you are getting at least another 20-30% more toilet roll. And they are 3 ply as well, so I certainly won't be buying these again\",\n",
       " \"I've been using this toilet paper for years because it's pretty decent and soft texture as both loo roll and as use as nose tissue.\\n\\nHowever this latest batch is awful! I might aswell have bought some 320 grit sandpaper, it's abrasive enough. The difference between older batches is noticeably rougher and I'm wondering if it's a load they knocked out during the early pandemic shortages and hence the quality is duff.\\nEither way, they shouldnt be lowering the standard of their products in this way.\\n\\nTime to find a new bog roll brand.\",\n",

Batteries did not last a day when using it.\\n',\n",

This is totally useless, the rotation features are very gentle and do not get rid of even weekly grease build up. It rotates like a toothbrush so gentle that you tend to press- on tough grease and stain, but if you press the rotation is hindered and just the noise comes from the struggling brush. Very bad buy.

Managed to put it back on but will have to watch it everytime I use it now.  The scrubber is pretty powerful hiven it is battery operated.  I bought it to clean in the nooks snd crannies around my windows. Did a good job. Just feel it is faulty cos of the button switch but I dont want the hassle of sending it back especially during COVID.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n  Bought it as our window seals are crap and had mold on, I sprayed the area with flash and then set on it with this Sonic Scrubber....After a short time the whole window looked near on new and not like something out of a horror film! (Ok my ocd was overreacting when it thought ‘Silent Hill’?!). But it was starting to grow fungi on one side.... :-0I give this gadget 10/10, not much physical effort either. Now on to sonicscrubbing everything possible....\\n',\n",

It's a powerful little tool. The brushes can be popped in the dishwasher and the different heads are really useful for different surfaces. I'm so happy I've started using this!\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n  I love this wonderful little gadget that gets into small spaces for a good clean. The heads are easily attached, they are cleaned easily and dry quickly. Put everyone in an ice cream tub and remove batteries after each use - batteries last longer. Even the instructions are in the tub - everything to hand. Perfect - thank you\\n',\n",

Hubby loves them. Good value for money, all undamaged, would buy againAnd I did!! Now dearer but wanted a thank you treat for the busy carers going into my Mother in law and going the extra mile every time they are in. So this is now the 3rd box iv bought. As also got replacement box as hubby finished his last box! All the 3 boxes wev received, chocs up to the top, all boxes unopened and undamaged. No white chocolates or out of date chocolates in all 3 boxes.\\n',\n",

       " \"\\n  Expensive, but kind of worth it as I thought my access to chocolate might be restricted during a particularly stressful time! These arrived promptly and are well packaged. You get about 2.4kg of Celebrations. Overall they were great, and it was alot of fun just to stick my hand in such a big box while watching a movie.But it does become rather obvious how few of the good ones you get when you see it laid out in such a big box. I would say the ratio of Milky Way, Mars and Galaxy plain were too high as even though we all know the favourites go fast (Twix, Snickers, Maltesers) on a normal day, I'm not fussy and I still found the ratio to be disproportionate overall. I mean it's chocolate so who's going to complain, it's just that if this ratio was repeated in a normal sized box, you'd find yourself with 2 Twix and 15 Milky Ways which is just SAD!\\n\",\n",

It's a hardcore electronic toothbrush for cleaning surface however I still find I have to, in most cases, use a detergent or cleaning powder...so it's really only replacing the scrubbing brush.  Maybe the more I use it the stronger I'll feel about it.\\n\",\n",

They were fresh and great mix of all the sweets Malteasers,  Galaxy Caramel, Galaxy milk chocolate, Mars, Snickers, Milky Way, Bounty twit.  No I did not count them as I don't want to know how many I ate!lol.These were very addictive and every time I had a Cup of tea I was eating them.  My husband didn't eat any he said he couldn't be bothered with the wrapper.....more for me!!lolGreat for a celebration (excuse the pun) so you can share and not eat them all yourself.\\n\",\n",
