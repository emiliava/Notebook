       "\\n  Auf der Suche nach einer Sonnencreme für mein Gesicht bin ich auf diese hier gestoßen und habe sie mir aufgrund der doch großteils sehr positiven Rezensionen bestellt.Die Creme lässt sich wunderbar verteilen, es bleibt absolut kein klebriges Gefühl zurück, die Haut wird nicht gereizt und fettet auch nicht nach, wie ich das von anderen Sonnencremen kenne. Geruch gibt es absolut keinen, auch das finde ich, gerade im Gesicht, sehr, sehr angenehm. Auch Make-up ist danach ohne jegliche Probleme aufzutragen.Als Sonnencreme für den gesamten Körper habe ich sie noch nicht verwendet, weil ich noch andere zum Aufbrauchen habe, aber mit meiner guten Erfahrung im Gesicht gehe ich davon aus, dass sich die Creme am Körper gleich verhält.Für einen Zweierpack um diesen Preis absolut genial.\\n      1\n",
