402,Snap Circuits PLUS Electronics Exploration Kits | Full Color Project Manual | STEM Educational Toy for Kids 8+ (SC-310),4.7,683,nan,better than they were,Ross,4.0,United Kingdom,Verified Purchase,Another thing that is better now than it was when I was a kid.  This is an outstanding idea that makes building the circuits a breeze so you can focus on the learning.One point lost because 1) too much emphasis on noise-producing circuits and 2) the whistle chip is not sensitive enough for work properly in some examples.,3,2020-03-10
403,Snap Circuits PLUS Electronics Exploration Kits | Full Color Project Manual | STEM Educational Toy for Kids 8+ (SC-310),4.7,683,nan,Great educational toy,DaveB,4.0,United Kingdom,Verified Purchase,"I had something a bit like this when I was a kid - that was over 50 years ago! The kt I had was made by Philips and was much more fiddly to use as the components were connected into the circuits using tiny spring clips and you needed to use wire strippers. This is much easier to use as the components are mounted on plugs which locate into a board. Bought this for one of my nephews for Christmas. He hasn't actually received it yet, but I'm anticipating most of the family will enjoy building electronic gadgets with it.",3,2019-12-21
405,Snap Circuits PLUS Electronics Exploration Kits | Full Color Project Manual | STEM Educational Toy for Kids 8+ (SC-310),4.7,683,nan,Good but I’m hoping it turns to perfect.,R. May,3.0,United Kingdom,Verified Purchase,My son loves this.  We’ve tried a few circuits and he loves seeing the results and understanding how things work.So why only 3 stars??  A couple of the components are faulty (one being a switch that works intermittently).  I haven’t contacted the seller yet but hopefully they’ll replace the faulty parts and I’ll adjust the rating accordingly.  This was purchased at a reduced price during Cyber Monday deals so I don’t particularly want a refund as I’d have to pay much more to replace it so I’m hoping the seller will resolve the issue directly.,11,2019-12-30

Kerr,5.0,United Kingdom,Verified Purchase,"My grandson (aged 7) is not very academic, but thoroughly enjoys the little electronic projects they make at school. He was absolutely delighted with this kit, which contains the bits and pieces to make lots of little electronic gizmos. Stupid Grandma let the side down however by failing to provide any batteries! We robbed something else of its batteries so he could get one of the projects going.As an aside, I opted to have this delivered 'without Amazon packaging'. I understand that this means the contents will be visible, but to my horror, the box arrived with no packaging at all and the address label stuck straight on the box. It took me at least half an hour to carefully, carefully, peel this off and then another half hour gently rubbing the sticky residue off with nail varnish remover to make it look like a present again. The box also arrived quite battered, which I couldn't do anything about. Lesson learned there!",1,2020-01-04

He loves the fan which flies in the air, but only if you connect one way - it reverses the other way and can’t get up speed or direction to lift.

He's recently turned 7 and I wasn't sure if he would manage given it says 8+, but it's a brilliant combination of being simple to put together, but having enough about it for it to be suitable for much older in terms of the learning involved.  He can follow the instructions himself, but the concepts will keep him learning more for several years.  His current favourite is the spinning disc (although he did lose it behind a bookcase yesterday).  We were at a relatives on Saturday and he literally spent all day on it, several hours on it on Sunday, did another two experiments before school today (and was excited to show me his dark activated light).

I'm pleased with this, I think it looks great, the computer plays very well. But there are some things that need improving imo. Not enough space to store the pieces. The power socket should be at the back, else you end up with the lead coming out the front. The pieces are a a little cheap looking although I do like the silver. As far as software features, there's a few choices for length of games etc and various other set up options, but there's no feature that gives you a rating as you finish each game.  It would be great if it matched your rating with an appropriate opponent rating. I still enjoy it and I'd certainly recommend it to anyone who wants electronic chess but isn't expecting things like internet play etc.",1,2020-02-13

But it has a few irritating features which may be deal breakers for some and could so easily have been put right during design. Firstly it’s 5 stage dimming is unnecessary as even the dimmest is way too bright and illuminates my room! And if you turn the display off but want to check the time in the night by pressing the button, it lights up (with a loud click) at its brightest setting! You then have to do a further 4 loud clicks to take it back to the ‘off’ setting. By which time everyone in your room is wide awake!",12,2020-03-07
10133,Bedside Wireless Charging Non Ticking Radio Alarm Clock with Dimmable LED Display - Mains Powered Dual Alarm Clock with USB Charger and Bluetooth Speaker,4.1,2684,32.99,Nice looking but with draw backs,SaraG,3.0,United Kingdom,Verified Purchase,"Nice looking very neat and easy to set up, however it wasn't until the first morning when the alarm went off (it was set to radio not bleep) that I noticed to volume gets louder and louder. Re-read the instructions nothing to tell you how to stop this. I contacted the manufactures who replied stating that there was no way of setting the alarm volume the 'getting louder' was part of the design feature. Also there is not the option to set alarms for certain days i.e. mon-fri or mon-wed-fri etc so if you work a varied shift pattern you have to remember to manually switch the alarm completely off or else you are woken up when you don't want to be. In hind sight had I been aware of the lack of these features I would not have purchased this. It does charge my iPhone ok but that's not really the point !!!",31,2020-02-18

The sound quality is very good at low to medium volume but not something you could blast your music out through.

It does the job, is very stylish and is not too bulky or large for a dresser which also had a lamp and other items on it. I'm very happy with this purchace and really like the fact theres a USB charging port on the back!

Lovely to look at and i could make room on my bedside cabinet. Not to sure about the alarm as i only wanted for charging my phone and clock display. Clock dimmed nicely so no disturbed sleep. I've charged my phone every night with no issues..... until early hours of sunday 2/2/20. When a funny noise woke my husband and me up.  Now I'm not sure if it was the clock or phone making the beeping but when I took my phone off the clock it and the clock was red hot and i mean extremely hot. My phone (s10) was behaving really strange but after restarting it it was ok. I've since charged my phone on another wireless charger and all ok. Since this episode I've been afraid to use it overnight and have returned to amazon. Please please be careful. I dread to think what would have been the outcome if we hadn't woke!,4,2020-02-03

Build is robust and looks great. Sound quality is more than adequate with good volume. Display goes from bright to very dim to completely off. Wireless charging works great plus a usb at the back for another device.  Bluetooth signal is strong with no dropouts from my S10. FM radio has plenty of presets and works fine.

But it’s in my bedroom so I don’t need to see it in the day time.I haven’t been able to use the phone charge facility with my iPhone 6 as it just doesn’t do anything, but that’s not a big problem.It’s easy to use and best of all it’s made in the UK which is a big plus!",1,2020-02-15

The brightness is OK but needs to be changed from night time (so it doesn't keep you awake) to day time (so you can red the actual time!).

I already have 3. A Toshiba 1tb and 2 WM passports 1tb each, one usb 2 & other usb 3.
Independent Backup storage is a must. I dont trust cloud storage. If sony can get hacked! Etc.
Also Bitter experience when I had no backup... my dodgie daughter killed my computor with an even dodgier website!!
All hard drives are good although WM usb2 one didn't shut down properly once or twice to allow safe disconnection. All much faster storage than all my usb stick drives.
I like 1tb. It's massive enough for photos videos but also Sony PS4 storage. Having 4x1tb units has the advantage if a unit fails I don't loose everything.
I learnt from again from bitter experience its better to leaving 1tb with photos elsewhere. Rotating regular guards against loosing precious memories to fire and other home destroyers! Fire boxes won't stop them melting!!! Not my daughters doing that time!
Another point. I have micro and standard usb storage. You won't accidently put it through a wash and dryer. Although the toshiba stick did still work. And the WM won't slip out your pocket unnoticed or your dog find it and chew it!!!

10649,"WD 4 TB Elements Portable External Hard Drive - USB 3.0, Black",4.7,32447,69.74,Beware If Buying For PS4,Gazza13,1.0,United Kingdom,Verified Purchase,"Whilst this drive does *technically* work with a PS4, don't allow yourself to get a false sense of security. The drive does not require an external power source beyond the USB itself, which (from what I can gather) seems to be the root of the problem. It seems that the PS4 USB ports don't always supply the perfect level of power for the drive, so it's smooth operation is very hit and miss. It something happens to the power supply (power outage, shutting the PS4 down completely, sometimes even just putting it into rest mode - yes, with the setting on to keep power running to the USB ports), the drive start to spin, beep once, and then emit a sustained and unbearable beep until you unplug the power. The only way at this point to get it working again is through pure trial and error. Unplug / plug during a full reboot, unplug / plug while going in / out of rest mode. Extremely irritating - especially when you've spent 15 minutes trying to find the right combination to get the drive powered properly, of which you also spent the last 10 of those minutes convinced it will never work again and that you've lost all of your data. Sadly, I'd stupidly disposed of the packaging before I realised that this was going to an ongoing problem, so I wasn't able to return it. WD won't do anything, as technically the drive works (they've since changed their item description to remove any reference to PS4).

The Horstmann timer was very old and working fine, but i wanted to change this for a digital one.
After reading the reviews and contacting Horstmann technical service, a really nice guy, Steve, assured me
how easy this was to change.
As mentioned by other users here, this is a doddle to change.
Switch off power. Unscrew the old front face. There are 5 wires connected to the back plate, via spade connectors.
They are marked 1 to 5. Simply pull each one out, remove the old front face.
This new one is a direct backwards compatible, with the same 5 wires, spade connections.
Simply push each one to the corresponding number on the back plate. Offer this plate to back box,
and screw to back box.
Set the GMT/BST switch. All done. Its factory pre programmed for economy 7, so you dont have to set the time.
Fantastic product.",2,2020-02-23

15708,Bose SoundSport Wireless Headphones - Blue,4.,5165,95.00,Great sound but uncomfortable for my ears,Struan Robertson,2.0,United Kingdom,Verified Purchase,"When I lost my old running headphones, I looked at all the reviews for possible replacements - and I found there wasn't an obvious winner. Clearly there's a lot of subjectivity in headphones, particularly when it comes to comfort. I chose the Bose in large part because all the truly wireless ones I considered had a feature I disliked about my old Plantronics Backbeat Fit headphones: to adjust volume, or to hit pause, effectively requires jamming the tiny speakers into your ear. Which can't be good for your ears; and hurts. With the Bose, the control is on the band, not the speaker. The sound quality is excellent. But I found the fit uncomfortable: the design requires putting them in the ear and twisting them, which creates a seal like some sort of sonic toilet plunger. It's as fun as that sounds. When I ran, they fell out 3 times over the course of an hour. I tried a different size of ear hook (3 sizes come in the box) but still they felt uncomfortable. (Additional, niche issue: if you wear these at the gym, and do squats with a barbell, you may find that the little metal shirt clip is exactly where you'd rest the bar on your shoulders.)A big thank you to Amazon Prime, though: I contacted support to explain I'd worn the headphones and they weren't comfortable; could I send them back? Yes, they said. I can't imagine many retailers would offer a full refund on headphones after they've been put in someone's ears. Here's hoping for you, dear reader, they're not re-sold to you.",1,2020-02-04
15717,Bose SoundSport Wireless Headphones - Blue,4.,5165,95.00,Poor design and fit,Amazon Customer,2.0,United Kingdom,Verified Purchase,"I've had these for a year now, and have used them frequently, mostly in the gym and running etc.  This is my first review, but I thought it worth doing as these cost quite a bit of money.The whole time I've used these the poor fitment has been a constant niggle.  I wouldn't say I have odd ears in any way, normal ear buds always fit great, but the design of these do not fit at all well.  They sound great as long as you're not doing much and you're in a quiet environment, but as soon as you use these for any sport related activity (so there's either wind noise, music in the background, or you're own movement) they lose the seal in your ear and you get lots of background noise, even at full volume.  This is especially crap considering they're sold as being made for sport.I have tried the other size rubber attachments that are included, as well as paying extra for aftermarket ones.  None have fit properly and I'm now sure it's just down to the poor design of these rubber bits.  So after finally giving in after a lot of frustration I have bought new wireless earbuds at half the price, which seem to sound just as good but also seal perfectly.",2,2019-12-09

The fit is absolutely perfect and clearly thought out. This is far removed from the efforts of beats for instance with their poor hook design. As far as the sound goes.. well its Bose.. if you don't know their quality you haven't owned any of their products before. My pair did actually start to break down after 4 years of use in both the gym and all other aspects of my life. I contacted Bose to ask about repairs as I'm of the mind these days that repair is better than disposal. To my surprise they simply replaced them! I'm assuming they re-use electronic components and it's the plastics that are disposed of perhaps. I can not recommend their products and their customer service more.,0,2020-01-02

26440,"TP-Link AV600 Powerline Adapter Wi-Fi Kit, Wi-Fi Booster/Hotspot/ Extender, Wi-Fi Speed up to 300Mbps, 2+1 Ethernet Ports, No Configuration Required, Wi-Fi Auto-Sync, UK Plug (TL-WPA4220 KIT)",4.3,20479,38.99,"Wonderful WHEN they work (2 didn't, one did) - but remote wi-fi complicated to set up",Paul Haynes,3.0,United Kingdom,Verified Purchase,"This does two things: it extends your internet connection over your house mains wiring (which it does very well and is dead easy to set up), and it extends your wi-fi (which it does in two different ways - one very easy to set up, but of limited use, and one much more useful, but a bugger to set up).

As an internet extender, it's a wondeful product - mine works perfectly in the shed at the bottom of a 50m garden, with God knows how many connections/sockets/plugs inbetween the two ends. So, if you want to take the laptop down to the shed (or upstairs to the back bedroom) and plug it in to the extender with a bit of ethernet cable, it's a superb solution.

However, if you want to use your laptop over wi-fi, the picture is more complicated. You can configure these adaptors as wi-fi repeaters, which is very simple (just press a button on you router and another on the extender). But this only gives you a decent signal if your extender plug is close enough to the router to pick up decent signal itself. So, great for the next room, but not so good for the back bedroom - and my shed remains wi-fi free.

To get wi-fi from the extender plug itself, you have to configure it as a mini-router, and this is complicated (don't bother with the - very confusing - instructions, there is an excellent video on Youtube - the url of which Amazon won't let me give you!!). But it works - and wi-fi in your shed 70m away is yours for the having.

So far, so good (except for the rubbish instructions). But then you have to deal with the quality of the product itself. And here the picture is far from rosy. I was so impressed with the original extender (which came with the base plug), that I ordered a second one. However, this wouldn't work, so was sent back. Its replacement worked OK, so for a few weeks I had wifi in my shed, whilst my daughter could do her homework in her bedroom. (It very cleverly uses the same address and password as your router, so devices can switch from one to the other fairly seamlessly.)

But then both (BOTH!) units started playing up - providing intermitent wi-fi, or none at all. I reset both and followed the wonderful Youtube video once again - one came back to life, the other was fine with paired internet, but refused to do wi-fi. So now it's the daughter's homework or me listening to Radio Caroline in the garden. You can guess who won that one...

It's taken me a while to get round to sorting this out, so I'm beyond a reasonable time limit for returning the faulty unit (without a lot of fuss), and I don't know if it's worth trying a fourth one. Or maybe I should get a cheap router and plug it in the shed? (edit - this is what I did in the end)

Such a pity these are so unreliable, because, with better quality control (and much better instructions!) this would be a really ecellent product. But as things stand, all I can say is try it and see - but be ready to send it back if it doesn't work (and don't expect too much from the replacement). Good luck.",33,2020-03-03

Setup was relatively simple. Pairing process is extremely easy and changing SSID and password is straightforward (and explained in instructions). So long as you are familiar with accessing your router settings you should be more than capable of setting it up.

Ethernet connection seems to work as well as if my pc were plugged directly into router. However, the broadband at my house is terrible (max 3Mbps), so I can't really comment on the 300Mbps claim. It also makes it harder to judge whether the powerline is at fault when my internet drops out.

The only issue I have had is the WiFi connection kept cutting out randomly for short periods of time. This was largely fixed with a firmware update for my router but still happens every so often and can be frustrating.

Finally, the only other minor thing I noticed was the included ethernet cables are cat5, which as far as I'm aware has a max speed of 100Mbps. So if you want the 300Mbps wired connection you will need to use your own cat 5e.

Just to prove a point I put my old P200 adapters back, and they worked for a week with no disconnections across the mains. I contaced TP-link support via Amazon, and supplied them with all the info I had collected in trying to diagnose the problem, they did respond but were just asking pointless questions that had already been answered by the info I had proved to them - Just like all so-called tech support desks I have ever encountered. I had the Base unit plugged in downstairs near my Router and connected with an ethernet cable and the Wifi extender unit upstairs in my man cave. Just to experimnet further, I plugged the WiFi extender unit in downstairs on the same ring main as the base unit, the connection speed went up to about 380Mbps and flucuated from about 330 - 400Mbps still nowhere near 600Mbs. This seemed to stablise the connection, and proved there is nothing else wrong, but the unit is nowhere near my man cave now, so completley useless for the reason I bought them.

I'm not a bot and I wasn't paid for this. I hope this makes this review more believable and if not - oh well. I don't review often/ever tbh but I had to write one for this. I'm going to attempt to write this in a way that helps non English readers easily translate the text so sorry if it's long:

It was difficult to decide which TP Link to choose since the prices and capabilities vary product to product. In the end, I went for the AV600 and it was a perfect choice. Easy instructions (take your time, do not rush), do as you are told and it SHOULD work (hopefully lol).

Don't let all the crazy sounding features of the pricier ones trip you up if you are not sure what to buy. For the average user of the internet; browsing, reading, streaming, downloading and even gaming is perfect with this. I have plugged my PS4 into my TP Link using an Ethernet cable and the speeds are fantastic. Low ping (around 15 - 25ms when playing Apex Legends) and download speeds 30 - 40Mbps (stats will vary depending on your ISP/Broadband provider, where you live, and so on).

I was uncertain if the WiFi on the AV600 was going to be any good but it is perfect - weirdly it is better than router. I chose to give up pass-through (i.e. being able to use the socket) for the WiFi functionality and the cheaper price. Well worth it - works perfectly with my phone and laptops. You will notice most of the TP Links with the pass-through option do not additionally offer the WiFi functionality (unless you spend a lot of money). Choose wisely.

If you have the money to spend, get the pass-through version that also has WiFi built in because it's less hassle in the long run. However, if you are like me and have plenty of sockets to spare and hate spending money, the AV600 will do just fine.

Life before this device was simply mediocre when it came to gaming, streaming and general internet usage - I thought my ISP was rubbish and all I needed was one of these.

I can not recommend this more.

I bought this hoping I could get wifi in a static caravan sited near the house.

For those who think this needs to be on the same circuit to work, it doesn’t, it will work beyond that.

I plugged the adapter in the BT router and power up. I then plugged in the extender in a socket near to the adapter and paired them as per instructions. The wifi network appeared and tested ok. I then move the extended to a different ring main in the kitchen, it worked the same. In each case the ‘powerline’ Led with lit steady.

NOW! This is the system the signal will have to get through, (This is the Live path, neutral less complex) {show approx distance} –

1. The Adapter in the house off a spur on a ring main {25m}

2. From there, inbound through consumer unit (cu1) RCD and Switch (sw) onto incoming mains

3. Now to a 2nd cu2 supplying and outbuilding. Outbound, through sw and RCD then into armoured cable {30m}

4. Cable enters building to cu3, through sw, RCD to ring main. {6}

5. Outbound from here leave goes to 32A caravan socket, then through 32A Flexible cable {20m}

6. Enters Caravan via 32A socket that connects to caravan cu4. {2}

7. This cu has 2 rings for sockets, a spur off ring 1 has a socket were the extender is plugged in {2}

I plugged the extender in this socket in the caravan and powered it up. Power led ok, wifi led ok, but powerline led flashes (before steady), this means signal low (not surprising!), however it worked fine. I tried streaming TV on a tablet and it worked brilliantly from anywhere in the caravan.

I bought this as a punt, not really thinking it would work, but it did! I guess TP-Link say “the same electrical circuit” knowing it should function ok like that. However this example proves that it’s better.

And the story didn't finish, the same issue with all 3, WIFI module works fine but TL-PA4010 NO. as result I have 3 useles components which I relied on them! I tried to sync them separately with no success.
On top of the range of the connectivity in powerline is small compared with my PA8030P and they have a lot of latency with timeouts!
I'm not happy with my choice and take into consideration to take more strong models.",0,2020-01-08

I have a conservatory about 15 metres from the plus net router.

I was unable to get wifi in the conservatory. Plugged the extension in the main room adjacent to the conservatory, plugged in main unit and powered both up and pressed sync and they synced and then pressed wps on router and wifi button on the extender and had wifi in conservatory.

Plugged extender in garden room, wandered up to house and pressed sync on main unit, hurried back to garden room and pressed sync.

A few minutes later had wifi in garden room.

Painless and much easier than i was expecting so very happy and does what i need it to.

Wifi seems much faster, havent had the server unavailable error message as it times out.

Very pleased. Will see how long it lasts, has a three year warranty so hopeful.

Update, the conservatory proved a bit hit and miss so bought a second set. The pairing didnt work with the extender in the main room so i went to the music room and both paired without a hitch. I now have Full bars of wifi in the Conservatory and plugged the second unit into the garage where i can watch training videos and have a spare power unit should the original one go down.

Brilliant bit of kit.",0,2020-01-05

Ordinary traps were of no use. Bait was being eaten without setting off the traps and I was having no luck with catching anything. In my utility room I have dry dog food for my Alsatian, Rex. Rodents were travelling between the attics and the utility room to feast on kibble and return to the attic. I bought the Victor electronic trap and set it up. Two weeks later I caught a shrew. As it turned out the shrew was too small to catch in your typical mouse trap. So, all in all a victory. Usually, I would catch up to 6 mice per year in your standard mouse trap. I see the best set-up of typical mouse traps in addition to the electronic trap, to be ideal. Mice that are shy of standard traps, or smaller rodents (the shrew), are more likely to be trapped by the electronic trap. Provided you check, and empty, the electronic trap regularly, you should have no trouble with decomposition of a rodent in your trap. I give this electronic trap 4 stars!",0,2020-03-05
37656,"Victor M250S No Touch, No See Upgraded Electronic Mousetrap Black",3.8,6968,34.99,JOB DONE!!!,Oliver Rawding,5.0,United Kingdom,Verified Purchase,"We have had this make of trap before and required some more for a winter increase in mice indoors. These suckers never seem to fail. I have read plenty of mixed reviews but I just don't get it. Over a one week period 11 mice shuffled off this mortal coil and went to join their maker. I have now not seen 1 mouse or signs of since then. Think I might have got them!The good thing about these traps is that there is no scraping bits of mice off the traps or off the walls when they've been 'mushed' in a mechanical trap or the smell of decaying mouse when they've made it to a nice out of reach spot to die after being poisoned. The one thing I would say the BEST thing, by far, to bait these traps with is peanut. And I can say that the mice couldn't give a stuff if it's cheap, expensive, nutty, smooth or even organic.",1,2020-04-01

The mess was indescribable, although I can try - they basically shredded almost everything and what the couldn't shred they used as a toilet.  Cleared all the mess out and wanted a trap that would be fast and humane, but which wouldn't muck about.  So, on a friend's advice, we got this ... baited with peanut butter and it works a treat.  Light didn't flash when making a kill though so still have to check daily but that's a good habit to get into - the only thing that smells worse than a live mouse's pee is a dead mouse.  No mess because it doesn't physically injured the mouse, just electrocutes them.  No idea on battery life yet as we've not had it long enough, but it does what it claims to, and to all mice in the area I'd just like to say You Have Been Warned - we're kindly folk but if you smash our shed up we're going to war.

37661,"Victor M250S No Touch, No See Upgraded Electronic Mousetrap Black",3.8,6968,34.99,Definitely effective.,Niko,4.0,United Kingdom,Verified Purchase,"Mice in the attic is not something anyone wants to hear. We're kept awake every year in the lead up to winter by gnawing and scratching above our heads. Poison is usually effective but ultimately means that there are mouse corpses rotting away somewhere and not something I want.

I bought this, set it up and on the first night caught one of the little buggers. It's simple to use and clearly very effective at doing its thing.

Pros
- Effective at its job. No more partially murdered rodents dragging their sorry selves around in pain. Zap and done.
- No mess. Other traps can leave a real mess, snap traps can basically eviscerate/behead mice. We've had it and I'd rather not have it again.
- Easy. Whack in the batteries. Put the bait on the bait spot. Put it in area they run through. Turn it on.
- Quick clean/reload, no touching disease/lice ridden bodies. Open the top, empty into bin and repeat above (minus batteries)
- Pretty humane. It's sad to have to kill animals but ultimately live catch traps mean one of two things, they're coming back or infesting someone else's house depending on how far away you take them OR they are probably going to be attacked or vulnerable without a nest/knowledge of where food is out in the wild if they were born and raised in your attic in winter. Snap traps can do half a job and it's not pretty. This thing either works or they get a jolt, either way it's over quickly.
-The trap isn't going anywhere. With snap traps they can sometimes easily survive long enough to drag themselves and the trap behind kitchen cabinets/under fridges and be lost to rot away somewhere, plus you just lost your trap. With this they are not moving it anywhere.

Cons
- Even on offer it's kind of pricey. Decent snap traps can be picked up for pennies on the pound and you can have multiple traps going. £20 is not something you're going to double down on too much. This feeds into the next problem.
- Lack of repeatability. Once the trap has done its job it's out of action, in fact other mice will quite happily climb over its furry friend to steal the bait he/she was trying to get. This wouldn't be an issue if they were a bit cheaper so you could put multiples down but they are not. Frankly there really isn't any excuse for this price, the electronics inside can be found inside of poundland fly swatters and it doesn't even include batteries. Either make the trap a repeater (like the much more expensive and way overpriced big brother version of this one that costs about £50) or make it reasonable please, your brand name isn't *that* reputable. I hate to say it but mice are rarely alone and can breed like... well mice. Trap many or GTFO unfortunately.

Summary/TLDR

Would I buy it again? Probably. It works. It's effective. It's easy. It's less messy in multiple senses of the word.

However it is over priced and not really a practical option for dealing with an infestation, they will literally breed faster than you could kill and check traps in all but the most convenient locations. If you're not squeemish, have loose morals about killing vermin humanely or are on a budget just get a ton of snap traps/wildlife friendly poison and get the job done.

I used cooked chicken in the trap but next morning there was no mouse- although I saw it a few times during the day. Tried the trap with cooked sausage- still no luck. I added extra traps of the standard variety and was annoyed at spending so much on this trap.

I added peanut butter which I needed to buy specially- and TA DAAA- dead mouse!

I left the trap up for another day and TA DAA again- another mouse.

So my only advice- use peanut butter!!! I have left the trap in case there are some more mice lurking but I recommend this product- seems clean and easy to use and it seems to zap the mouse quickly and humanely.",0,2020-01-13

I was pleasantly surprised. It amplifies the sounds around you to such a level, I could easily hear a couple of the guns talking on the next peg which, without the ear defenders, I couldn’t hear before.  They kept my ears warm and are very comfortable to wear. They tackle their primary role very well. I was, at first, expecting the sound of the shotgun to be almost completed muffled but this was not the case. You can hear the shot very clearly but not at all deafening. Almost as if it was a shotgun fired from some 100 feet away. As the sound waves hit the ear defenders it instantly turns down the volume, which is only noticeable as the regular volume returns after the shot. On a still day these work perfectly but on a windy day you will need to turn the volume down, otherwise you will get a lot of wind noise as it passes over the microphones. But even with the volume turned down, surrounding sound can still be heard. For the price, they are a bargain. More expensive ear defenders may do a better job but at this price you can’t grumble.

I was very disappointed to find that when the looper was engaged no signal was able to pass through it to the amp - in other words I could not hear what I was playing, either the backing track or any overdubs.The looper did however record everything and was able to play  back everything with the excellent sound quality that I wanted - but if you can't hear what you are playing it's not much use.Reference to the internet suggests that this is a fairly common problem which doesn't say much for TC's quality controls, especially as this is supposedly a premium product with a premium price tag.I decided to take a chance and return the product in exchange for another one and guess what?

42000,"TC Electronic DITTO LOOPER Highly Intuitive Looper Pedal with 5 Minutes of Looping Time, Analog-Dry-Through and True Bypass",4.6,1923,nan,An excellent first loop pedal,Sebastian Palmer,4.0,United Kingdom,Verified Purchase,"This is my first loop pedal. It's been a real education as to the sloppiness of my playing!

To get good loops the first loop you lay down needs - if it's a normal type of music (ambient soundscapes, for example, might be more forgiving) - to be perfect. Subsequent layers of overdubs can be added, and the start-stop timing of these is less crucial. But the relative timing/tightness remains important. I'm finding that my four or five part rhythm tracks - emulating bass and several rhythm guitar parts, etc - are, at present, way too sloppy.

My hope is that this pedal will enable me to get better at the execution and layering of these parts, such that I'll then be able to create decent loops over which to practice scales and soloing, and even to drum along with. As a musical tool it's terrific, even if it's a bit depressing initially in highlighting my shortcomings.

So why just four stars? Well, as far as I know you can't store - other than retaining the current loop you're working on, by leaving the pedal on - your loops. And you can only undo the last loop you overdubbed. And if you accidentally hit record again after a duff loop, you can't get back to the previous one. More expensive loop pedals have more of such functionality. And you'll quickly see why folk want these options. I want them already!

But as a first loop pedal this is an excellent device, which - despite its limitations - I'd heartily recommend.

UPDATE: I've discovered that the Ditto Looper does in fact store the last/current loop, even if power is cut to the pedal, when I accidentally did the latter.",6,2019-12-31

42225,"TC Electronic DITTO LOOPER Highly Intuitive Looper Pedal with 5 Minutes of Looping Time, Analog-Dry-Through and True Bypass",4.6,1923,nan,Possibly the Most Addictive Type of Pedal You Could Use,Mattko,5.0,United Kingdom,Verified Purchase,"What’s not to like about this pedal? It looks good, sounds good, fits easily on your pedalboard, and importantly - it’s simple to use. Not only this, but the countess hours of fun you can get from a pedal like this is totally worth the money.

The Ditto Looper records your playing and loops it back at a 24-bit audio quality which is uncompressed. As result, the audio that is being looped doesn’t sound worse in terms of audio quality than what you may be playing over the top of the loop. I have found that the more layers you add to a loop also doesn’t seem to affect the audio quality. You can distinguish the different layers you have added to your loop, and fortunately it doesn’t become a distorted mess. The pedal also doesn’t colour your sound when playing through it, as TC Electronic claims. Additionally, the pedal can loop up to five minutes of audio, which is very generous and likely more than you’ll normally need, but it gives you more possibilities, and you can recreate entire songs in a single loop.

As for the controls, there is the “Loop Level” control which controls the volume of the loop audio, and there is also the switch which is responsible for controlling everything else. The switch relies on different simple commands you give it to control the pedal. For example, a single click to start or stop recording, or double click to stop playback of your loop. A nice feature is that you can erase mistakes that you make my holding down the switch, which deletes only the previous layer you recorded.

The LED light has good brightness and makes it clear what the pedal is doing. For example, the light is red when recording, green when playing back a loop which flickers when the loop restarts, and the light flashes green when the loop is paused.

So, are there any downsides to this pedal? There are, but they’re probably not enough to stop you from buying one, and they won’t apply to everyone. Firstly, there are a lack of features compared to some other loopers with drum machines and other effects built in. But, for some people like me this is a positive as it keeps things simple, and also keeps the price and size of the pedal down. You can always add your own separate effects anyways if you have them in your effects loop. Also, the fact you have to double click the switch to stop the loop may be too slow or awkward for some that are using in a live environment. Lastly, if you want to add a new layer at the start of the loop when the loop is in standby, you cannot start recording straight away as soon as the loop is restarted. You have to wait a moment before you can press the switch again (otherwise it will register as a double click and stop the loop again). Normally you’d keep the record feature on past the end of the loop, but if you’re changing tone or effects (which takes time) you may have to wait until the loop is finished, then start recording again.

Overall, a looper is one of the most fun pedals you could get and you can’t go wrong with this one. Highly recommend! Hope this was helpful.",5,2020-01-12

I've had another set of digital scales that I use mostly for postage and product weights, but I wanted something smaller for the kitchen. To calibrate my old set I have a 100g and 200g weights, so I tried them on these and they are spot on. So having satisfied myself to the accuracy I went about my baking using them.

A tip with the battery change. I found that if you have the battery housing at the top of scales as you look at them, you will see to metal protrusions just below the battery. If you squeeze these together the battery pops out easier. I had trouble getting the isolating strip out from under the battery until I did this.

Using them is a breeze. Changing between imperial, metric and mls couldn't be simpler, just keep pressing the button until you get what you want. I love the fact that you can zero out after adding each ingredient so you save using lots of different containers and save washimg up. So that makes them environment friendly to. And switching between dry weight and wet. I do have one bowl that is a little large for these scales in that it blocks the display when looking down , so I have to bend a little to see it.

It’s easy to clean, easy to use, and quite honestly I think it’s correctly priced for what you get.Hope this helps =)",0,2020-03-14

Great idea except that they break constantly. There are lots of spare ones, but we broke 6 dart tips in 2 games - so we have enough for another 6-7 games at that rate. Even worse, they break where the plastic joins the brass and it's impossible to remove them without a drill. Not exactly child-friendly. The tips are soft enough that they don't damage skin, but they do create small holes in the plasterboard wall - not a problem where we have it, but I'd hate someone to do it in their living room.",0,2019-12-26

45591,"Ring Stick Up Cam Elite by Amazon, HD Security Camera with Two-Way Talk, Black, Works with Alexa",4.,897,nan,Fantastic cameras from Ring,Don't leave reviews,5.0,United Kingdom,Verified Purchase,"The Ring cameras are fantastic, no problems at all. I paid for my cameras to be installed via amazons installation service but, that is because I'm disabled. I would have easily fitted these myself if I was still able-bodied.I spent quite a bit of time doing my own research before opting for these Ring cameras, and I will share my knowledge if it helps. I'm with Sky as my ISP (Internet Service Provider) I only pay for 37 MBPS in speed. After doing my research on Wi-Fi mesh networks I decided to opt for the BT Whole Home Wi-Fi Triple Pack (which you can buy from amazon for £161.98) I didn't think they were overly expensive and It nearly doubled my speed up to 75 MBPS! The big bonus with these BT Wi-Fi discs is they work with any ISP (Internet Service Provider) be it Sky, Virgin, BT etc. There is also an Ethernet port at the back of each disc which means hard-wiring your Ring cameras via PoE (Power Over Ethernet) an absolute doddle. If you want a stable service and great picture with your Ring cameras you have to go PoE in my opinion instead of wireless. Only one of the discs has to be plugged into your router via Ethernet the other two you can move around your home to boost your signal. I live in a 2-bed bungalow and everything is working great for me but, I've also read many comments from people who live in houses who have purchased these discs, and they work great for them too.The Ring cameras are fantastic, and getting the app for them via the play store for your phone or tablet is easy and free! The same goes for getting the app for your laptop from the Microsoft store for windows. I took out the monthly plan for the Ring cameras the same day great service all round.",4,2020-02-26

The 1st unit purchased was faulty (the WiFi died after 24 hours), and because set up requires WiFi I couldn't even set the device up using an ethernet connection! Second device came quickly and worked fine (thanks to Amazon for the quick returns procedure). My main issue is that I had wanted to set the camera up as a nursery camera for when our toddler is asleep. However, LIVE VIEW IS RESTRICTED TO A MAXIMUM OF 10 MINUTES. What kind of security camera does not allow a permanent viewing connection? I assumed that this setting could be changed, however it's hard coded which is ridiculous. Needless to say, I'm extremely disappointed that this security camera cannot be used as a security camera.",4,2019-12-23

I'm going to work out where to fit it outside (not sure if it will like facing South when the sun is low) , but on testing looking out through double glazing, it responds well, even to motion (not so well at night, but they do warn you about this).

I'm not sure how well it will survive our British winter weather and it is a pity it doesn't come with a much longer USB lead. Luckily you can buy 8 m ones that works well with it.

I'll add to this review once it is fitted outside.

Picture quality is good (but then it should be - its not cheap).",1,2019-12-20

The customised motion detection works pretty well and is the highlight for this edition. The only down point of this is if you do not subscribe to  the ring protect plan, this camera is literally useless  by that I mean you can only use it for live view. No recordings and the snapshot feature is disabled. Hence the one star otherwise it is a good camera. Ring should at least give 24hr recording as a basic standard. I have not tested the POE option as it seems like a lot of hassle with extra cabling and power leads.",1,2020-01-16

To buy a brand name would be 4x the cost. However to most hobbyists this would make a great soldering station option. Ive never owned a digitally controlled iron before and the ceramic core with hollow tips allow it to heat up Incredibly quickly. There are 5 alternative tips provided (1 of those is identical to the one fitted and probably the most commonly used) and station makes a good attempt at providing everything you need to solder, only lacking flux and desolder braid. The stand for the solder reel is a quaint touch but may not suit everyone's soldering technique. However its screw attachment means its optional so up to you if you want to fit it or use it separately from the station.  Overall for the money,  I'd highly recommend this station.",9,2020-01-09
47666,"Preciva Soldering Iron Station, 60W Professional Digital Soldering Station, 90-480℃ Temperature Adjustable Repair Tool Kit with Soldering Tips, Solder Wire and Frame, Sponge, Suction Device, etc.",4.,913,40.99,First impressions,A. Butler,4.0,United Kingdom,Verified Purchase,"This arrived yesterday and I've had it out of the box to test/use it already.The box it comes in is small and tidy with all the things packed inside.The iron itself is on a nice flexible lead, not one of those mamba types that fight you every inch of the way while trying to use it.  The base unit is however on a mamba lead and not very flexible at all.In use the iron heats up very quickly and holds temperatures very well.  The dial used to set the temperature is a little fiddly to be honest but I don't need a precise temp for what I'm using, within a degree C will do and this thing is easy to set like that.I was impressed with the bit that the iron has installed out of the box.  It worked!  Normally I need to overheat them a little and dip them in solder to get them to coat (properly called 'tinning the bit').  This one was a breeze to get going, no problems at all.So why only 4 stars?  Well, the iron is fine, better than fine so far, very good in fact.  It's the other things that come with it that are letting it down.There is a solder sucker that doesn't.  It sucks at sucking.  Worse than useless.  I have a very old one I've had for 25 years that is a lot better.The lead-free solder is cheap and not worth using.  Personally I don't like lead-free solder and don't use it, it 'furs' after a few years and has to be replaced.  This is a common failure in modern equipment these days, the lead-free solder they use just doesn't last.The solder holder is quite useless as it keeps the roll by the stand/main unit if screwed in (for stability) rather than where you're actually doing the soldering, which thanks to that nice flexible lead can be several feet away..  If not screwed in then its too light to really do the job of holding your solder reel properly.  I've given up on it and use it just to keep my solder handy for use by having it with the main unit and I remove it when I need it.",14,2020-01-16
47669,"Preciva Soldering Iron Station, 60W Professional Digital Soldering Station, 90-480℃ Temperature Adjustable Repair Tool Kit with Soldering Tips, Solder Wire and Frame, Sponge, Suction Device, etc.",4.,913,40.99,"Simple, easy to use, I love the temperature readout.",Amazon Customer,4.0,United Kingdom,Verified Purchase,"I bought this because I've always bought soldering irons on a cable before. They're cheap, you switch them on, and use them.... that said, I've just thrown the last one away because it didn't seem to melt the solder despite getting hot. I selected this because it seemed a reasonable price and I liked the sound of the actual temperature being visible.
I have used the device once, and I can say it definitely seems to work as I expected - you can watch the temperature as it gets up to heat or cools. Incidentally, it heats up incredibly quickly - way quicker than I expected given my previous experience with standard soldering irons.

I felt the instructions let the device down a bit in so much as I think the two machine screws that come with it are so you can attach the solder roll holder to the side if you want to, but I couldn't see how to do this. Everything else was self explanatory though and I ultimately decided it was best not to attach the dispenser as it means I can use the box it came in as a storage box. It packs away really neatly..

The solder sucker seemed cheaply built (very light compared to one I bought in the past), but it worked really well so I can't fault its operation and it was a welcome addition to the kit.

I can't compare this to others that are similar in price, or much more expensive because I've not bought one before, but, I'd definitely buy this again from my experience so far as it seems to meet all my needs. I'm not really clear what much more expensive options could add extra, but I'm only a hobby level user.",4,2020-02-18

After a lot of blown components and poor solder finish I decided to look for something else.I wasn't sure about this one given that similar solder stations cost a lot more. But given the reviews I decided to try it. Well, I've been using it a lot lately and actually it has improved my soldering. I like the temperature display and it heats up so fast it's ready in less than a minute. My last one took at least 5 minutes. For me it's perfect for my needs as a hobbyist, but not sure how well it would do in the hands of a tradesmen in daily use.Very impressed for the price",1,2020-02-19

49122,Monopoly Voice Banking Electronic Family Board Game for Ages 8 and up,4.4,2718,nan,The best version yet!,SonicQuack,5.0,United Kingdom,nan,"I've moved on from Monopoly in my love for board games, however I like to keep my hand in. I was a bit disappointed with the Electronic Banker edition, which tried to streamline the game but the technology, in hindsight, wasn't as good as it needed to be. This one however - I'm impressed.

This iteration does not remove the runaway leader aspect that is evident in most of the versions. Perhaps that slow erosion of other players wealth is your draw to the series. I find that slog rather depressing, so at least it's quicker in this version. My taste though, is not under review.

Less properties per side, with only the need for a single house (or in fact, an option to go straight to a hotel) really speeds this up. It feels like Monopoly Lite. It makes for potential 30m games with two players, just over an hour with four (keeping it snappy). Less lucky games can still be a couple of hours at a maximum (but not that four hour affair of the original). The maximum player count is four with updated player tokens (including a dinosaur!).

The only cards are the deeds (minimal content upon them, with the reduction in housing above) and a single GOOJF card (you'll work that out). This keeps clutter to a minimum and the absence of money is handled really well. The digital assistant is top notch for two reasons. Speech recognition is very good - it does make the odd error, easily undone with the cancel button (and can be repeated with the other button). More importantly, it's concise. A little theatre is added with sound effects, however there are no long monologues - it's quick and to the point, facilitating swift gameplay. The speech is clear and doesn't sound cheap. This was exceptionally refreshing and a genuine surprise.

Each player gets a player aid, explaining how to verbally activate each choice (purchase a property, pass go, demand rent etc.). After a short time it's easy to carry out your instructions without needing to reference the card. All book-keeping is automatic, clearly explained by the digital assistant. You can also ask about your balance and who's winning too. The whole digital integration in to the classic game has been well thought out to make it as simple as possible. Since each player has their own button to use (player piece dependant) keeping track is easy and if you make an mistakes the game usually points it out.

There are other changes to the rules in there to spice things up too. Trading player cards without consent mixes things up in a ""take-that!"" way, auctions are simple and how running out of money is tracked, enforcing sales, keeps things flowing quickly too.

Overall, this simpler and accessible version is a real winner for me and I'd no longer fear the family or friends suggesting a game.",1,2020-02-16
49123,Monopoly Voice Banking Electronic Family Board Game for Ages 8 and up,4.4,2718,nan,"Different rules, different quality to the original. Poorly made, do not recommend.",bookworm8,2.0,United Kingdom,nan,"Very disappointing. I do not like this at all, and it is not very user friendly, it feels as if it is made on the cheap just to trade on the Monopoly name. There is a maximum of four players, which is too limiting. The playing pieces (tokens) are all made of a green plastic - almost indistinguishable from each other unless you are really close, which is confusing. The houses and hotels are an even flimsier plastic and move out of place at the slightest draught. The box states that there are 8 houses and 12 hotels. This set has 7 houses and 13 hotels, hardly effective quality control!  The rules are a bit different and the game is soon over, which is a relief as the poor quality meant that there is far more frustration than pleasure. The top hat idea wouldn’t have been better if it recognised different voices more easily, for us it didn’t and it made the game so irritating. It is now back in its box, we have returned to using our old, original Monopoly, which is shabby now but gives lots of fun, includes all of us and does not force us to have auctions/trades.",2,2019-12-21

49125,Monopoly Voice Banking Electronic Family Board Game for Ages 8 and up,4.4,2718,nan,An Alexa type Monopoly and we are sold!,Micky - bookphenomena,5.0,United Kingdom,nan,"We have played this all over Christmas as a family and we're still not bored. One of the things about monopoly is that the money is a pain and the cards hanging about the board are also a pain. This version of the game takes all of the hassle out of the game and allows you enjoy just playing!

In the middle of the board is a simplified Alexa-type module that responds to voices and prompts. You move around the board as is traditional with dice and a character, but according to what you land on, you press the appropriate character button and for e.g. buy property or chance card, or pay rent. The module keeps a tally of all your money, property, houses etc. Cheating is not possible and we found the game so much more fun.

The board itself is more simplified than it used to be (but it's not just this version, monopoly seems to have done this to all new editions) in that each suit of properties is only two not three and community chest has gone, just leaving chance cards.

I can't recommend this version of the game highly enough and the price is very fair.",0,2019-12-30
49126,Monopoly Voice Banking Electronic Family Board Game for Ages 8 and up,4.4,2718,nan,Completely ruined the Monopoly experience and we all gave up within 5 minutes of starting.,🎖Skipping Lion,1.0,United Kingdom,nan,"I absolutely love Monopoly, as do all my family. I also love tech and innovative new improvements to everyday stuff. This looked like the perfect combination - so I ordered ready for the Christmas/New Years holidays.

Upon opening the product everything was looking good! It’s probably the most aesthetic Monopoly board of all time, it really does look great. The character pieces look good quality and the main command unit looks really cool.

HOWEVER...

The command unit was unbelievably frustrating! Mr Monopoly got almost EVERY command wrong!

To make things worse, you then have to physically press the “X” button to rectify any mistake made, before continuing with the game.

We followed the instructions to the letter, but nothing seemed to work.

It completely ruined the Monopoly experience and we all gave up within 5 minutes of starting. It’s unplayable!

Ruined my plans of playing Monopoly with the family over the holidays. I really wish I just ordered a classic version.

Overall, this is an absolutely terrible product. It looks good but who cares when it’s unbelievably frustrating and barely works. Get the classic version instead. Hasbro, what are you doing to Monopoly?!",1,2020-01-18
49127,Monopoly Voice Banking Electronic Family Board Game for Ages 8 and up,4.4,2718,nan,Really disappointing.,Anthemusa Reviews,1.0,United Kingdom,nan,"We are so disappointed with how awful this is. Let me preface the following by saying that we are massive Monopoly fans in this house. We already own 5+ different versions of this game and play it regularly so we were super excited to get this new version. Unfortunately it was a total let down and I definitely wouldn't recommend it as a version of the game.

We've played a few times now. The starting money amount is not enough to do very much, you need to have rules for 2 players (such as no auctions). The whole ""trade"" square is silly (especially with two players). The two of each colour set is not enough. The lack of transport squares is disappointing. Everything about this version takes away from any skill you need to play monopoly, and makes it all about luck of the dice. (I hate games purely based on luck).
The voice needs a volume control, and we have had a few moments where a cough has been taken as a command or we wanted to undo something and you don't know if you have or not. The pieces are not the best either. They are all sort of see through green and look quite similar to each other. And the property values are awful. Not much difference in each set of colours. Not much better to have whole set on one side to the opposite. Major fail on the money side of it! Having now read the reviews about it not understanding people, we didn't have that as such. It just picked up every tiny noise we made and took it as a random command.

If I had to look for the positives, there are a couple. We thought the hat was ok - it understood us. It could potentially be useful for taking away on holiday as a condensed version of the game since it's smaller than the original and most variations. If you happen to prefer games of luck to games of strategy, you may prefer this version.

But for me personally, I wouldn't recommend this one over older versions at all.",0,2020-01-10
49128,Monopoly Voice Banking Electronic Family Board Game for Ages 8 and up,4.4,2718,nan,A bit like comparing 20/20 cricket with a test match!,Victor Meldrew Mk2,5.0,United Kingdom,nan,"This isn't Monopoly as you know it!  I have compared this game to the full version as something akin to the difference between 20/20 cricket and a full test match.  Basically this is a much more interactive game and, unlike the original, the first player who succeeds in getting one set does not nearly always win.Out of the box you receive a board, the voice banking module, a set of property cards, 4 player pieces (not 6) and hotels and houses.  4 players is not the only change.  This game has been designed to be much quicker and at first, we thought that it would not be as entertaining.  How wrong can you be.  So what is different?+. Only two properties per set for a start, unlike the traditional games where it is only the Mayfair/Old Kent combination which is two properties and the rest three.+. You only have to buy a house before you purchase a hotel, not 4.+. Community chest has been consigned to the bin, you only have chance now -similar with utilities.  The stations remain, but now, via the voice controller, when you land on a ""station"" you simply get told to move to a different location+. in place of the utilities, you now get exchange care.  Land on this square, pay $100 dollars and you can exchange one of your property cards for someone else's; even if they don't want to.  Straight swap if you wish, Old Kent for Mayfair!!  This livens up the game and removes the option for the gloating relative, who hoards all the properties and both spoils and prolongs the game to be forced to release properties.Game play is much simpler and thankfully over quicker now.So what about the voice banking.  Well you have to play it in a quiet environment in order for the voice recognition to work properly.  We found that the module recognised our commands over 90% of the time and if not, we pressed the reset button and gave the command again.  It really is very good and kept a tally of our financial state, our bank balances etc - even declaring the winner when someone iOS made bankrupt.It is questionable as to whether this is a better game than the original board game, personally, as the difficult relative who generally hoards the properties and makes everyone's life hell, I am not sure, for everyone else, it is far better and particularly younger children, who having failed to secure a property empire in 20 minutes or less go off and sulk.  Now they are engaged much more and even when losing, enjoy the game much more.Not necessarily better then than the original, but our family really enjoys playing it.",0,2019-12-27
49129,Monopoly Voice Banking Electronic Family Board Game for Ages 8 and up,4.4,2718,nan,A simplified version of an old favourite,YvonneB,4.0,United Kingdom,nan,"My husband and I are big fans of the original Monopoly game and have played it many times. This new version is good and does not take as much space as the original as this one uses an electronic top hat interactive banking machine.

The board has 1 less property per coloured property section, e.g pink properties on the original only have 2 properties on this one. There is no paper money as the machine is used instead.

When we play Monopoly we tend not to have any background noise so for two adults this game was good, but we did have the occasional problem when using the machine. My husband has a strong local accent so he had to make more of an effort to speak clearly. I tend to speak quickly and again this caused the machine problems.

The game does not take as long to play as the original one, that can take several hours.

Overall this was a good game, that does have a few problems with the interactive machine, but its okay if we speak clearly and slowly. The playing pieces do not feel as good a quality as the original ones and there are less individual playing pieces. I think my husband and I both agree that we do prefer the original but that is because we have played that version so many times. I do think that it would be good for those new to the game though.",0,2019-12-28
49130,Monopoly Voice Banking Electronic Family Board Game for Ages 8 and up,4.4,2718,nan,Montony-opoly: Banking edition,Aidan,2.0,United Kingdom,nan,"Gave up on this because halfway through each game the banker decides a property is held by the wrong person and can't be fixed, so game over.That aside it's been watered down to a classy version of snakes and ladders. There's no taxes, no train stations (it's now a annoying trip to a random place on the board, only two of each set, you can buy a hotel for one property and have the other vacant and for some reason the rent is the same as the purchase price?!  I like the idea of the computer figuring the finances out but it just gives you the sense that everything is free and you have no idea who's rich or about to go bankrupt. The bank suprisingly good at voice commands but just not good enough for a board game. If you want to hear someone going ""buy...buy...buy..."" for 5 minutes because the hat doesn't understand their voice this is the game for you.Ignoring the fact the pieces are cheap green transparent plastic so you can't make out which piece is yours this is suitable for 8 year olds and no one else - it might even bore kids after 2 games.

BUT it has always been a slow game especially if you had the full 8 players.

The biggest problem has always been the banker who has to work out just who owns what and deal with a fat wad of notes..

The game intodays X Boxes and the like was too slow and a little too complex for players.
Hasbro have succeeded in speeding the game up by restricting the number of players to just four and in replacing the banker with a Voice Banking Electronic system.

Now I found that the game speeded up and the game was much easier to play.
True you do have to take the time to pronounce the words and places correctly for the voice recognition system to understand.

49133,Monopoly Voice Banking Electronic Family Board Game for Ages 8 and up,4.4,2718,nan,Good fun but a few areas for improvment.,James,4.0,United Kingdom,nan,"Negatives:
- Box flimsy- No way of organising cards in box, no elastic or section- Player pieces all same colour - very confusing for players to find their piece- Player pieces fall over, hard to tell what way they are meant to go up- Voice recognition unit only really understands RP/Queen's English. Us Irish had to put on an upper class English accent to be understood. - Voice unit makes frequent mistakes and misunderstands directions
Positives:
- Game is fun- Games are shorter than the classic Monopoly game which drags on for hours- Game is simplified version of the full game
The game is fun, but as an adult, I could see myself getting bored pretty quickly, but the kids enjoyed it.

The micro shredding is brilliant. Compared to my previous cross-cut shredder there is absolutely no chance of reconstructing the documents and also the waste bin is not rapidly filled with strips of paper and an astonishing amount of wasted air-space. The micro shreds fill the bin far less quickly and are easily tipped out and disposed of. A neat perspex window in the front of the bin shows you how full it is. The shredder also munches up credit cards quite nicely into shreds that can't be identified or reconstructed. Oddly though it won't deal with CD's or DVD's.My use is for low volume home/office and whilst the blurb says it will cope with 8 sheets of 70 gsm paper at a time, I find that it 6 sheets of 80 gsm paper are as much as it wants to cope with. Card and thicker paper need to go through as single sheets. It is noisy to operate but all shredders are. For occasional domestic and light office use it should be fine. It will definitely struggle with bulk shredding operations and the manual says it will cut out after 5 minutes of continuous shredding after which it will time-out for 30 minutes to protect the motor.I have ordered some Fellowes shredder oil to keep it in peak condition and if it continues to perform well I shall be very pleased.",6,2020-02-28

Probably dangerous! Deffinately Not Fun!,Guy,1.0,United Kingdom,Verified Purchase,"The image of the contents shows a control board. When you are eventually able to find, download & unzip so you can read the tutorial/directions (not possible on a tablet) you discover it does not start at beginner level. Instead initially concentrates on programming.
page 10:
""Lesson 0 What is Arduino
What is Arduino
Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software.""
& you are thinking: when you do get to actually connecting any of the components supplied? Then further down the page you find this gem:
""Elegoo UNO
In this tutorial, we will use the Elegoo UNO control board to build the example circuits as a reference, and these Lessons will show you how to use these electronic components correctly.
*This Kit dose not include the Elegoo UNO control board""

So what is the Control board supplied & what use is it? Or is there ANY control board in the package.
This was sent direct as a gift - you fairly believe that the image shows the contents included.
Its not until you get to page 43 that you get any information that's going to tell about the Fun? kit contents in any helpful way.
But the illustrated connections indicated are not even possible because the controller is so different and not explained.
This is supposed to be suitable for a beginner but it is far from that.
It could have been helpful if the control board referred to & pictured with illustrated example had been the one in the Fun kit but it isn't.
Worse you don't even get to anything like beginner until page 43 of 223 up until then it wants you to connect to a computer & download programming information & links.
Something few cautious begginers would want to risk. Especially if they have become dubious about the company from the unhelpful tutorial and suspect damage might be possible.
If you just want to learn about electronic components & how they work to be able to do some really simple things and to understand the uses as well as dangers which is really important this will not help.
So seriously regret getting this which was supposed to offer helpful beginner tutorial as a gift for a youngster.
It is not helpful. having looked at some of the other negative feedback which confirms our experience, now we think it is potentially actually dangerous.
such a disappointment.",2,2020-01-04

We robbed something else of its batteries so he could get one of the projects going.As an aside, I opted to have this delivered 'without Amazon packaging'. I understand that this means the contents will be visible, but to my horror, the box arrived with no packaging at all and the address label stuck straight on the box. It took me at least half an hour to carefully, carefully, peel this off and then another half hour gently rubbing the sticky residue off with nail varnish remover to make it look like a present again.

He's recently turned 7 and I wasn't sure if he would manage given it says 8+, but it's a brilliant combination of being simple to put together, but having enough about it for it to be suitable for much older in terms of the learning involved.  He can follow the instructions himself, but the concepts will keep him learning more for several years.  His current favourite is the spinning disc (although he did lose it behind a bookcase yesterday).  We were at a relatives on Saturday and he literally spent all day on it, several hours on it on Sunday, did another two experiments before school today (and was excited to show me his dark activated light).  My 70+ year old Dad loved doing some of it with him - especially the sound activated light.  I thought I might be worried about him breaking it but it's really solid construction.",0,2020-01-20

It has a very fast response time that delivers fast-moving content with almost no blur trail and has very low input lag. It is a cheaper, slightly less featured variant of the heralded and very well reviewed LG GL850 which is exclusive to another UK retailer. The only difference between this panel and that one is the GL83 has a slightly lower colour space due to the use of a different backlight and no USB ports on the back. That being said it still shows almost the entire sRGB colour space which is used by the majority of content.

The monitor comes pre-calibrated by the factory with a calibration report in the box, and with a slight tweak to the brightness (from 50 to 15) you can achieve a great colour temperature and fantastic accuracy. Additionally, the monitor comes with multiple overdrive modes to enhance pixel responsiveness, choose Fast, not Fastest, as the Fastest setting introduces horrific inverse ghosting and overshoot. The fast setting performs the best with fast transitions and very little blur or trailing.

Finally before wrapping up with pros and cons, you can see from my photo that I have it VESA mounted and I had no problems doing so on my Amazon Basics Dual monitor arm.

Pros
+ Fast response times with almost all pixel transitions within the 6.94ms window of 144hz.
+ 144hz IPS monitor 27""
+ VESA mountable (100x100)
+ Thin 1cm bezel on sides and top, slightly thicker on the bottom
+ Freesync monitor that is also Gsync compatible (works with AMD and Nvidia graphics cards)
+ Price (I paid £330 - which is stunning for an IPS 1440p 144hz monitor)
+ Colour accuracy
+ Great viewing angles
+ Excellent grey uniformity
+ Excellent gradient handling, no banding issues
+ Joystick style button to control the OSD is fantastically easy to use and navigate

Cons
- Claims to be HDR but peak brightness and lack of local dimming means its not really HDR
- Contrast ratio is 894:1 (Like other IPS it suffers in very dark scenes in a dark room but its not very noticeable and can be aided by using bias lighting behind the monitor)
- Lack of availability?

Other facts
* Thickness with stand is 16cm, without the stand it is only 5.6cm.
* Comes with 1 display port and two HDMI connections which are very accessible
* Bezels are thin at 1cm around three edges, slightly thicker on bottom bezel.
* Weight with stand is about 6kg and without stand its 4kg
* 27"" panel, 2560x1440p resolution, 144hz refresh rate
* Freesync and Gsync compatible
* HDMI only reaches 120hz
* Comes with power adapter brick and both HDMI and DisplayPort cables.",162,2020-01-15

You can easily see pixels. Another thing is very poor black and in my opinion very poor contrast. All the contrast measures are good only because of good brightness but real contrast is not so good. I decided to stay with my very old S23A750 monitor. I cannot even notice G-sync advantages.  I expected much more from this new model. The two things which are really good is colors and viewing angles. Unfortunately there is no black color and response time is not so impressive so in my opinion this is waste of money.

Takes a bit of setting up if you want to use g-sync and / or HDR but both easy to do and fairly customisable within windows settings and the Nvidia control panel. Like the monitors onboard settings aswell ( have mine set to gaming one). HDR kinda sucks at the moment for anything other than playing games that support HDR but can't be bothered to turn it on/off all the time. Windows desktop looks awful in HDR ATM but imagine Microsoft will patch that eventually. Chrome also looks very grey in HDR so if you want to use HDR for browsing use Firefox. I would recommend leaving HDR off for now as the colour and brightness of this monitor is great without it and there is not a huge amount of games out that support HDR.

I spent over a year researching monitors but nothing fit the bill (I was sure I wanted IPS for the colours but I also didn't like the response times until LG came out with this and the 27GL850). I've only had it a day but the 144Hz is noticeably smoother in games. Yet to try with an FPS but World of Tanks and Rocket League are much prettier for the colours and frame rate. I got it on sale at £385 but paid £310 as had an amazon voucher, pretty sure I couldn't have gotten a much better deal (I am blocking out the fact that I just missed the Black Friday price of £330). For the price I paid it's fantastic, and I now see they've put the price up to £500 which the 27GL850 is also currently available for.

There is no backlight bleed I can see, only IPS glow in the corners in dark scenes but if you view from slightly further away that disappears. The stand is slightly larger than I expected but the height and tilt adjustment is very handy for minimising the glow.

The screen seems slightly more reflective than my previous one - I notice the reflections more in my lit room in dark scenes, but maybe it's just because it now takes up so much more of my vision.

Overall a good purchase. I might be disappointed by the blacks if I paid over £450, though I knew from the beginning I was going to value response time over contrast which made this monitor an obvious choice. It's a beautiful image with any lit content.",4,2020-02-18

I would have liked to have seen a plastic or cardboard handle on the outside of the box to help with carrying. This would mean a little extra money for the manufacturer to pay out but it would be worth it.

A good looking monitor with an adjustable stand. The menu is quite easy to use with the little joystick button under the front part of the monitor.

ORIGINAL REVIEW

Perhaps I was unlucky, but my monitor has a tonne of stuck pixels. Enough that it's not even worth trying to count how many there are. Though some of them are unnoticeable during actual use, more than a few are easily seen even whilst gaming

In terms of IPS glow and black light bleed, I am happy with the monitor. Picture quality and response times are also excellent. But I can't look past the terrible pixel issues and will be returning this faulty monitor and ordering another once they're back in stock. If the new one is of the quality I expect., I will update this review.

This monitor had no black light bleed and very minimal IPS glow on my very first purchase (granted you may not be as lucky but LG quality control seems miles ahead of Asus and Acer).

Gsync works out of the box perfectly and the colors are calibrated fairly accurately already. Response times and input lag are excellent for an IPS monitor. The contrast is the only aspect this monitor is a little behind in compared to the competition but it is better than TN panels and only slightly noticeable next to another IPS monitor if you are looking for it. If contrast is important to you rather opt for a VA panel but then you will have to deal with slower response times.

No backlight bleed or dead/stuck pixels. There is however some notable ips glow on the bottom left and top left in dark imagery. Cant notice it on coloured content.

The power cable supplied is short. You may want to buy extensions if a power plug is far away.

The stand is sturdy however takes too much desk-space to the point it overlaps my mouse pad. It wouldn't be as much of a problem if it had side to side adjustments.",1,2019-12-03

One thing to note though, this is a FREESYNC monitor, not a GSYNC monitor originally, so the GSYNC features are unavailable on Nvidia cards unless they are the 10-20 series. Thankfully I have a GPU coming that supports Gsync, however my 970 couldn't use the monitors features fully.",0,2019-12-04

Quality of the product is amazing
Picture is amazing
I’ll highly recommend this product
The only con I have is that the stand isn’t rigid enough so if you shake the table a little ur gonna feel it on the monitor. And you can’t tilt it enough... but overall great product",1,2020-01-25

The colors are vivid and ciewing angles are amazing. The only downside is 1080p resolution on 27"" display, since you need to sit a little further in order not to notice the pixels. Also there is a little IPS glow, but nothing horrible. I would say it is the best 144Hz IPS gaming budget monitor.",0,2020-01-10

Perfect companion to a 5700xt. Very good colour accuracy out of the box, blacks are a little crushed so I'm using one of the ICC profiles from a reviewer (thanks motherbear).
