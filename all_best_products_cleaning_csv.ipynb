What happens 6 months from now when they are no longer buying and I am, so I deserve the usual old price and not some overpriced item caused by the panic squad with more money than sense.Please rebate for those of us not causing the panicking and not liable for price increases like this.\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n  We brought Andrex multi on a few occasions, and have previously thought how great they are, saving worries of running out of loo roll and bulk of shopping to carry. We received our latest order few days ago and the size of the rolls appears to be at least 30% less! Really can't be bothered sending them back, but will not by from here again - this shortfall was not just found in the muti pack, also the single 9 roles are the same size. (We tagged a single 9 to the order for comparison reasons) Actually, it would appear that Amazon have split a multi pack, as each roll in the standard 9 pack was the same as the ones in the Muti 45 pack (5x9).I've only just realised this as i write.\\n\",\n",

Since we’re in a loo roll crisis amidst toilet roll hoarding we shan’t be returning these but I’ll never buy Andrex again on principle!Loo-sers!\\n',\n",

I have attached a photograph. 52 Mars and just 19 Twix. The Mars, Milky Way, Snickers and Bounty were far more than others.But overall, like I said, good price - especially if you get it at £12.99 or around that.

They are probably the same price as tesco strongest bags as well.I use poke the bag through a hook and let it hang, without using an actual bin.

Also you can pull on them really hard (when wedged in the bin) and they don't even stretch never mind tear.  Even if they catch an edge they don't tear.  Will definitely continue to get these over alternatives.These are strong enough for alternative uses like garden green waste, small pieces of furniture and broken plaster board etc if decorating.

I used it straight away and was very impressed, it’s sturdy, I love the changeable heads, and the battery power is really good. I can’t wait to keep renovating our house and keeping it clean with this! It gets into all the nooks and crannies that you usually have to leave behind! I’ve told everyone about it already, and my family and friends have purchased it. Amazing\\n',\n",

       " '\\n  This product is a must have at home esp when it comes to cleaning in areas that are hard to get to. I saw this on Mrs Hinch you tube video where she was using it to clean her washing machine powder drawer. It cleans the whole area esp where mould starts to grow. I have used it to clean my sink and my Jacuzzi bath tub. It comes with different attachment for different purpose. It is like a giant electric toothbrush. It does the cleaning in half the time.\\n',\n",

       " '\\n  This product is moderately successful in removing black mould if it is near the surface, but it doesn\\'t remove it \"immediately,\" and doesn\\'t work at all if the mould has worked its way down significantly into grout or silicone caulk.  The foaming action is a useless gimmick.  As other reviewers have noted, it turns to liquid too quickly for the foaming action to do any good.The main reason I am giving this just one star, with a recommendation not to buy it at all, is that it reacts very strongly with chrome plating, especially the kind of chrome plating on plastic bathroom trim.  There is a  recommendation regarding this in the fine print, but besides being nearly illegible is not worded strongly enough. The product is badly designed and not fit for purpose, as bathroom facilities (showers especially) would be almost the most common use, and what bathroom doesn\\'t have chrome plated drains and other trim?  In my case, even though the spray was applied far from the drain, just rinsing down the surface caused the chrome around the drain to decompose into black sludge, That\\'s no joke.Fortunately for me, the broader outcome was happier than that described in the review by poor Mr. Troy Savage. My dear wife stood by me, mould and blacked chrome sludge and all. I was so touched I was moved to give up drinking altogether, take up jogging at least 10km a day, became a vegan, and I\\'ve never felt better.\\n',\n",

The spray itself is easy to use and instructions are somewhat clear - if I could actually read the instructions. That leads onto my next point. The item was in a plastic bag within a regular amazon package parcel. The item was either not secured properly, or it just has a leakage problem - I noticed that other customers also had this problem as they have left it in their reviews. The plastic bag was soaking wet and as I opened it, it was all sticky & the corrosive nature of the product meant that half of the packaging was rubbed off and the bleaching type of smell just kinda exploded right out of the package - this is before I even opened the spray.Overall, I am happy with the performance of the product but wish that it would not have been delivered if it was leaking , not sure if Amazon or the producer is to blame for that but thanks.\\n',\n",

First time I used it the mould was too deeply rooted (the shower was an embarassment!) and although you could see a big impact it wasn't good enough, so did the strip/reseal.  I haven't had to do it since, though!

So I got out my phone to see if there was a gel version by the time I looked this Up I noticed that the mould had virtually disappeared.

Don't skimp on this part , and don't think it needs scrubbing in.  I then closed the door & left the window open.  This stuff really does smell like strong chlorine.

When I first applied this, it started to slide down the tiles and I thought oh no this is going to be rubbish, I sprayed it on down and across the grout lines and left for 30 minutes. I went back to the bathroom with a brush expecting to scrub, but this is were the WOW comes, my tiles on the whole were sparkling white (I've ordered another bottle, as my tiles were that bad), all I had to do was rinse it down.

Most haven’t really done anything, some have done a little, but the mould has soon returned.  This product has done the job with no scrubbing.  It has needed a couple of coats on stubborn areas but it got there.

Will definitely buy it again!\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n  My bathroom mould was getting really bad and I was getting sick of trying to wipe it clean and it not making a difference. I saw this product on a BuzzFeed article and after reading the reviews decided to give it a try. Sprayed some on a small corner just to test and within 30 min the mould had disappeared. So I then went crazy and sprayed the whole bathroom. Used the entire 500ml bottle in one go. That's how bad the bathroom was! But it really worked. All the mould has now gone and my bathroom looks brand new :D. The only downside I'd say is the smell. We've kept the window open all weekend and the smell is still lingering. I'm hoping it will go away eventually.\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n  Was sceptical about this after reading some reviews. It worked really well on the white part of the silicon. It does not work on transparent silicon. I had to do it twice to get it completely clear but it’s because it runs down the wall and doesn’t really have a chance to get to work.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n  Removed the locking clip as advised, but when squeezing the lever, nothing happened. No foam. So ended up having to remove the entire top in order to use it mixed with some water. Not very satisfactory. Operation went badly purely due to malfunctioning equipment. Although the product is quite good.\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n  I don't usually write reviews but I feel done with this product. I bought the foam.I applied on silicone around the shower tray that was starting to grow some black mould marks. I followed the instructions to the letter. After 2 hours I rinsed it and the result was...  an utterly waste of time and money. The silicone around the shower looks exactly the same that before the application.\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n  Pretty toxic smelling stuff, but it’s actually incredible at removing black mould. Spray on, leave on, and after 30mins-60mins you start seeing the mould vanish. Wash/wipe and reapply/repeat until gone. It’s taken a day or two to clear the bathroom of mould but having tried scrubbing and other cleaners with absolutely no success there’s no comparison.\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n  It's amazing how well this cleans black mould. Around the window frames and especially over the years a black type of dirt/mould built up. After 30 mins wipe off the foam from this spray and see the difference! I do wonder if the cream would be even better but the spray worked very well. Happy to recommend.\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n  Mould problem, no problem.. Just remember to use it regularly and cover your mouth and eyes before application. Safety first :) I have used this for the past 5 years and I cannot imagine my life without it. It is a must if you live in apartments or closed areas with low ventilation.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n  I did not read the sales literature properly and discovered that you cannot use this if stainless or aluminimum is close by. As a consequence I have not ben able to use this in my shower because of the amount of metal stainless steel in the area.A good reminder for me to read the sales litertaure and a warning to other potentuial buyers.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n  I had tried everything on the mould in my bathroom and nothing would shift it, so was not holding out for much when I ordered yet another Mould remover- how wrong I was, this was incredible. Within half an hour the mould was almost completely gone (a couple of stubborn stains left, which disappeared after I reapplied the foam). I didnt have to wipe or scrub at all. My bathroom looks brand new, could not be any more impressed by this product. It does run down the tiles slightly which I didnt expect, however this didnt appear to hinder the work of the product on the grout. To tackle this slightly, I applied it in long sweeping motions to make it lighter on the tiles rather than large concentrated blobs, that did seem to help it stay put more.\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n  I didn't expect this stuff to actually work beyond maybe removing the top layer of mold. After 15 min all the mold stuck into the actual ceiling material has gone. Like completely gone and my ceiling is whiter now than the rest of the ceiling, brilliant product 100 recommend.\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n  I've used this in rental properties and now in my own home and, boy, does it destroy the mould.It is a bleaching product and I would recommend giving the place a quick wipe before applying this. Didn't do anything for rust stains.Mould did return but I reckon it was slower.Fiddly to undo (with very good reason) but pay attention when you're handling it.\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n  Had some damp and slight mould in relatives house sprayed this with a few applications absolutely vaporised the damp and mould and hasn’t come back since is great .\\n',\n",
       " '\\n  Pretty good stuff I must say. Used to clean the black stuff on the washing machine seal. Sprayed and kept it overnight, then cleaned it next day morning. It really removed the dark mould. Also tried it in a few sealant and worked on those too. Not cheap. But works great.\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n  I thought removing black mould from silicon was impossible, but I thought I'd give this a go before I reseal my shower area. And this spray got rid of it. I wish I had come across this spray before as it would have save me loads of money and time. Absolute bargain !!!!\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n  I rarely would bother to write a review, but on this occasion I feel I must let others know my opinion (for what it’s worth). AMAZING. I cannot rate it enough. I have UPVC  windows behind wooden shutters, the black mould has been so terrible where it’s trapped behind the shutters I just couldn’t remove it. The area behind the shutters is small  I tried every thing neat bleach nothing touch it. This product is absolutely Amazing!!! Just spray on the mould and leave. No scrubbing or rubbing just wipe up the liquid. Black completely gone Can’t believe my eyes. Gone. Gone Gone. Really is a excellent product for mould removal.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n  Excellent!I had few misgivings when I purchased this spray.Sprayed on shower edges. The moulds were fairly easily  removed apart for very stubborn moulds. But when I sprayed on bath edges and bidet edge and was amazed to see ALL the moulds remover completely!\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n  Very good. Wish it was a thicker product as it did slide down the grout on the tiles in the bathroom and wouldnt stick where I wanted it to, but still it.produced pretty good results.  Some stubborn black spots remain but it looks much better than it did before and I'm happy.\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n  Much much better in terms of smell, and also liked the foam texture so you could see exactly where it was and it lasted a bit longer in the same place. Can't say it did the job any better than the spray liquid, but definitely no worse either.\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n  This is an absolute gem when cleaning up mould/ damp areas. Literally have to spray it in the affected areas and leave it work it’s magic! You don’t have to wipe or anything.... Just remember that when you first spray it comes out as liquid so cover your floor area with a large old towel or something,  as it can stain your carpet.It’s smell isn’t as strong as other damp/mould removing products, but window still needs to be open.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n  I have to say that this product is awesome- I don’t normally comment on purchases, but I feel that credit where it’s due! Used it on our bathroom tiles and hot tub headrests (tried everything but couldn’t shift the mould) - couldn’t believe the difference it made. I’m definitely getting more of this when it runs out\\n',\n",
       " '\\n  Used in my bathroom to remove black mould on walls, does the job well but I have used watered down bleach before and it did same job at a quarter of the price but the mould did come back, so the test is to see if the mould comes back which is to soon for me to comment on yet,\\n',\n",
       " '\\n  I was truly surprised by the effectiveness of the product. Foam spray and wipe and wash away. It’s bleach based so careful if you stand in shower tray to wipe and wash away foam.But, shower looks completely refreshed - black mould gone !\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n  Amazing product for our persistent mould in our bathroom! I've tried various other products over time but nothing has really shifted it. And for the price this is truly an amazing product, as you can hopefully see from the picture!It hasn't cleared it all together yet, but I'm sure with one more go it will be all gone! Success! And thank you Buzzfeed for the great recommendation!\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n  The only think good about this product is that is cleaned the shower drain/plug from all soap scum. It does not do anything to the mould on my sealant. It looses its foam before the half hour is up and then runs away. A total waste of money.\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n  Blast that mould this winter with this guys as it really does do the job, point shoot and wipe after 30m so make a brew and know it's working hard while your not ! If mould has gone all the way through the silicone it will clean it but you can tell and may need to replace it but if you catch it early on surface only then its GONE.\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n  Amazing! I've marked it down slightly for scent as it is very strong. I don't usually use chemicals but we are moving out and didn't want to leave the shower with the mouldy silicone! The black mould in the silicone was really quite bad and didn't think anything would shift it but after a quick spray which I left for about 10 minutes, it had completely gone and the shower and grout looked brand new! I wish I had taken a photo of before and after but it really is that good!\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n  Amazing product that makes dirty, blackened grouting look like new again. I was amazed when I first used it and now always have a spare bottle at home.It does smell and I would recommend eye protection, gloves and a face mask\\n',\n",
       " '\\n  Great stuff, even worked on our white shower curtain, probably not something you are meant to use it on but it worked and shifted this horrid glue workmen left on the bathroom floor. Smells horrid but what do you expect.\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n  We have grotty tiles due to age and neglect by former owner. This product really rejuvenates them and makes a lot of difference. It doesn't smell great with a bleach like smell but ignoring that it is very effective and recommended.\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n  We bought these on a special subscription offer via Amazon. We have since cancelled the subscription. The rolls are of the quality you would expect from this brand, but they are tiny! The smallest look rolls I've ever seen. I don't think you are getting value for money, especially if you are paying the normal price! Back to Costco!\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n  I usually buy quilted Andrex but it was out of stock - I definitely won’t be buying this again! I felt compelled to write a review as the rolls are smaller and the paper is much thinner so it’s a false economy. 2/5 as it wasn’t as expensive but crap quality.\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n  Damn it's powerfull ... Really good clean. BUT!!! There is one massive BUT. It really smells with chemical after using . Highly recommending use in the morning so it less smells afternoon.. it took 2 days to strong smell of chemical disappeared\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n  Was hoping it does what it promises but oh boy did it exceed my expectations, i mean this thing just works like magic against mould. Sprayed on the ceiling on the bathroom, left for about 10minutes and after just wipe away, and leave the windows open to ventilate and that's it. Really really pleased and will definitely buy again.\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n  Smells extremely strong so definitely ventilate well, however this stuff is worth the potential headache! Just spray on, leave overnight, and return in the morning find your grout sparkling white..no scrubbing necessary!\\n',\n",
       " '\\n  At the price I paid I am happy with the quality of the product but if I had paid the full price I would have been disappointed as this isn’t the same quality as the Andrex you buy from the supermarket.\\n',\n",
