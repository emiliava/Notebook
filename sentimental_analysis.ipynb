What happens 6 months from now when they are no longer buying and I am, so I deserve the usual old price and not some overpriced item caused by the panic squad with more money than sense.Please rebate for those of us not causing the panicking and not liable for price increases like this.\\n',\n",

Although the price is cheaper with discount, but it is not worth to buy at all. Please order and buy at local store if you could, as the quality and quantity will much more better than this one.\\n\\nI generally don’t give bad review, but I really feel disappointed about this purchase. This one star just want to thanks to the delivery driver for his hard work in this Covid-19 epidemic, and also want to appreaciate them for sending me the daily necessities that I need in this lockdown.',\n",

We received our latest order few days ago and the size of the rolls appears to be at least 30% less! Really can't be bothered sending them back, but will not by from here again - this shortfall was not just found in the muti pack, also the single 9 roles are the same size. (We tagged a single 9 to the order for comparison reasons) Actually, it would appear that Amazon have split a multi pack, as each roll in the standard 9 pack was the same as the ones in the Muti 45 pack (5x9).I've only just realised this as i write.\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n  Disappointed in these thinned out, less dense loo roll. Not like the Andrex loo roll stocked in store. These just be ones sent out online! It’s feels like Andrex are trying to pull a fast one by reducing the quantity and quality and hoping customers won’t complain or won’t notice. Since we’re in a loo roll crisis amidst toilet roll hoarding we shan’t be returning these but I’ll never buy Andrex again on principle!Loo-sers!\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n  This product sums up the pitfalls of buying from Amazon. You would naturally expect Andrex toilet rolls to be the same as the ones in the supermarket but these are more like a cheap roll that you buy in a budget shop; smaller than the standard roll, thin, not very soft, and the classic scam - the larger diameter centre (so less paper).  These are either fake or a scam deal arranged between Andrex and Amazon, either way it's a rip-off.\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n  I picked these up as there was a great offer on, when we usually buy another type of Andrex roll. These were great value for money, but when they arrived I realised why... They’re too thin, which my wife has only pointed out about a thousand times since. These are 2-ply, rather than 3, which I should have noticed before ordering.\\n',\n",

I might aswell have bought some 320 grit sandpaper, it's abrasive enough.

I bring in to work what I like to call \"desk fruit\" and only 50% of that statement is correct, yes it\\'s on the desk but it is in no way resembling one of your \"five a day\".

I had already started to do the floor before I thought to take before and after photos but took a photo of a small still dirty bit and then an after photo. Judge for yourself. Used The Pink Stuff cleaner on the grout, sat down and wizzed away wz the sonic scrubber. Wiped over wz a damp cloth when finished and floor as good as new again\\n',\n",

It does not have the power to remove any deep in-bedded dirt and if you push down to hard, will stop working.I would say totally pointless, unless you have no elbow grease and are happy to hold it in one area for a long time, then it will remove a small bit of grime, but not all of it. Batteries did not last a day when using it.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n  This is a useless design. I clean a lot so thought it will be useful to scrub away dirt and grease on kitchen hob and grout on tiles. This is totally useless, the rotation features are very gentle and do not get rid of even weekly grease build up. It rotates like a toothbrush so gentle that you tend to press- on tough grease and stain, but if you press the rotation is hindered and just the noise comes from the struggling brush. Very bad buy. I went back to my scrubber on the first use.\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n  Had this sitting in wish list for an while, moved into rented property but as can see tiles where grout was an little yellow in parts, also after scrubbing myself couldn't seem to get clean, along with the shower screen door rails was mucky also. Only used once but think over time it will keep it clean, as parts will need re-sealing where the dirt etc has got into the old sealant but im happy ... and now looking forward to using it on other small spaces and things that need it!\\n\",\n",

In fact EVERYTHING!!you just changeThe head according to your needs !!! Great discovery for me and good timing as it’s December and will make the perfect gift for my sisters ‼️❗️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ Thanks to all your customers for their reviews as it was definitely due to this I now have this very helpful tool that does all the hard work so I don’t have too🥳\\n',\n",

       " '\\n  These are great, soft and find adequate. Considering I have used these couple of months now, and always order them every two months or so. Highly recommend\\n',\n",
       " '\\n  Ok\\n',\n",
       " '\\n  Bought for hubby as wee treat. Good thing I did, went into hypo, diabetes  blood sugar was 3.8 and was going off the boil fast, ate few of these and felt much better in a few minutes. Hubby loves them. Good value for money, all undamaged, would buy againAnd I did!! Now dearer but wanted a thank you treat for the busy carers going into my Mother in law and going the extra mile every time they are in. So this is now the 3rd box iv bought. As also got replacement box as hubby finished his last box! All the 3 boxes wev received, chocs up to the top, all boxes unopened and undamaged. No white chocolates or out of date chocolates in all 3 boxes.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n  Ok for the money!\\n',\n",
       " '\\n  Fantastic\\n',\n",
       " '\\n  Bought a few of these, cant go wrong\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n  Expensive, but kind of worth it as I thought my access to chocolate might be restricted during a particularly stressful time! These arrived promptly and are well packaged. You get about 2.4kg of Celebrations. Overall they were great, and it was alot of fun just to stick my hand in such a big box while watching a movie.But it does become rather obvious how few of the good ones you get when you see it laid out in such a big box. I would say the ratio of Milky Way, Mars and Galaxy plain were too high as even though we all know the favourites go fast (Twix, Snickers, Maltesers) on a normal day, I'm not fussy and I still found the ratio to be disproportionate overall. I mean it's chocolate so who's going to complain, it's just that if this ratio was repeated in a normal sized box, you'd find yourself with 2 Twix and 15 Milky Ways which is just SAD!\\n\",\n",
       " 'Great for the holidays or birthday, the kids seem to enjoy and so do the adults.\\nI love the idea of the individually wrapped mini bars makes it nice to carry a few tiny pieces with you on the go, and as a gift it is perfect for families as there are different types of chocolate in this mix.\\nGood assortment, all the best chocolates in one box, something for everybody.\\n\\nI am definitely pleased with my purchase and I would absolutely recommend it.',\n",
       " '\\n  Will be purchasing again. Item as described. Great money saver.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n  Excellent\\n',\n",
       " '\\n  The idea is amazing, but I can’t say I’ve had amazing results with this. It helped most when cleaning tile grout, but for cleaning burnt on food on a pan it didn’t do much at all.\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n  Want to give 5 stars but was left feeling a little 'nuh'. It's a hardcore electronic toothbrush for cleaning surface however I still find I have to, in most cases, use a detergent or cleaning powder...so it's really only replacing the scrubbing brush.  Maybe the more I use it the stronger I'll feel about it.\\n\",\n",

       " \"\\n  This item is perfect if you like to put your chocolates out in a dish.  Comes in a thin plastic bag inside a cardboard box. Ideal for recycling rather than the plastic tubs.  Considering this is the equivalent of 5 tubs that's a big saving to the environment.\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n  I bought these for Christmas in the prime sale.  I gave my daughter half and ate the rest myself over a period of time.  They were fresh and great mix of all the sweets Malteasers,  Galaxy Caramel, Galaxy milk chocolate, Mars, Snickers, Milky Way, Bounty twit.  No I did not count them as I don't want to know how many I ate!lol.These were very addictive and every time I had a Cup of tea I was eating them.  My husband didn't eat any he said he couldn't be bothered with the wrapper.....more for me!!lolGreat for a celebration (excuse the pun) so you can share and not eat them all yourself.\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n  My sanity has been restored when this lovely box of celebrations arrived. If your finding it hard getting your food order delivered and your naughty food cupboard is getting low then this is what you need to buy. You won't disappointed.\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n  I bought 2 of these last year . And another at Christmas . As well as 2 more recently. They really are a great buy. And are such a brilliant bargain. With no end of Celebrations in the box for the money.And within the eating date too.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n  It is hard to switch off. I have tried pressing the off and on button numerous times to stop it working ended up taking battery out.Bought two by mistake opened this one up first so kept it and used it and like it.  But shall use the other base as it switches off properly.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n  Use mainly in the bathroom as we get a really bad build up of line scale in tiles, shower corners and in the sink. It’s amazing! Really powerful and comes with all different types of heads. You clean the heads by popping them in the dishwasher which I thought is really handy! Thank you Mrs Hinch for he recommendation!!\\n',\n",
       " '\\n  Like Celebrations ? find the usual boxes dont last long?  Then these are for you, a fairly well balanced selection  all in a big clear plastic bag in a box Simple. the only downside is they have all gone. Guess its time to reorder\\n',\n",
       " '\\n  Perfect while going through lock down and not being able to go out for sweets. Problem is we can’t stop eating them. Great variety as always and very fresh. Arrived fast and would recommend this seller.\\n',\n",

       " '\\n  There are no tins in this, but that is fine as you get a lot of chocolate for your money. Ideal for xmas so you can put In a dish and they wont all get eaten at once. Great value for money.\\n',\n",
