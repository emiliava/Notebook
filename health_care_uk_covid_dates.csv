1276,"NRS Healthcare M80282 Kura Care Easy Grip Children's Cutlery Set, Multi-Colour",4.7,1168,10.99,REVOLUTIONISED our stressful mealtimes,K. Higham,5.0,United Kingdom,,Verified Purchase,"Junior still can't hold a spoon at 2.5 years, has developmental delay and sensory issues amongst other things and always big issues around food generally. For some reason he uses finger and thumb to hold cutlery /really weak fist if we're lucky and ends up turning it upside down before it reaches his mouth (again for unknown reasons!) He also won't touch most food so we end up feeding him, but given his age he's been point blank refusing as he's craving control but just can't manage it. We've tried EVERYTHING...or so we thought!

The shape of this set has just meant he has managed to stab tomatoes and strawberries, scooped omelette and yoghurt and SOME MADE IT TO HIS MOUTH rather than his lap! We did iiiiiit!!!

Also arrived in a couple of days and the colours are appealing to children. The edges are curved so risk of injury is less, but the knife actually does cut and the fork is still pointed enough to actually get through food such as tomato skins, peppers etc.

We have had such stress around mealtimes recently and it sounds dramatic but it's honestly helped a situation that was starting to make the whole family miserable and dread mealtimes. Thank you so much!",3,2020-02-16

I couldn‚Äôt think of anything to write without being repetitive. I had to look online for positive affirmations after I‚Äôd constantly repeated the limited few I could think up myself. I am very grateful for many things in my life but I couldn‚Äôt think of enough to keep the diary interesting and repeated the same few things over and over again. Doing a good deed every day is tricky when you work alone most of the time so I had to put down daily jobs such as cooking dinner for me and my husband or walking the dogs. After about two months of repetitive writing I felt that the diary had provided me with absolutely no benefit at all. I prefer taking a walk with my dogs or spending time outdoors in my garden when the weather is good. That had a far better effect on my mind and sense of well-being. This may work for some people but I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it to anyone I know because my friends and family are quite similar to me and they wouldn‚Äôt know what to write.,6,2020-01-05

Field,5.0,United Kingdom,Colour Name: GreySize Name: English,Verified Purchase,"I bought this to go with a couple of books for my children (the 5 minute diary for the eldest and the 3 minute one for the younger child)... My initial objective was to get them to be grateful for their dinner... even if it's NOT chicken nuggets... be grateful you have food, you have warmth, you have comfort, even if the dinner had REAL chicken in it, as well as mushrooms!!! ... and that seemed to work, we got over that, not entirely of course, but a lesson has been learned (somewhat) in that department...
The unexpected by product of this experience however, is that THIS book grabbed my attention... it's not 'just' a gratitude journal which you write stuff down, it's the preamble, it's the all the information up front - the bit about why you're doing it in the first place...
That's what hooked me...
And then practicing the ritual with my daughters each day.
And at first, it was clutching at the obvious; grateful for food, water, clothes, warmth
But then something started to change, unexpectedly so... I started to dig deeper and feel more positive...
My gratitude now involves; realising my self worth and what I mean to my children, recognising what we have, not what we don't, grateful for opportunities and more meaningful, deeper reflection when it comes to positive affirmations....and one of my good deeds today, was simply 'Acceptance'... and 'Acceptance with grace'...
I love this book.
I have recommended and even bought copies for friends and colleagues...
I am more positive, more energised, more determined and dare I say happier in myself... I didn't even realise I needed changing, my days had been focused on other people and things and work and jobs which needed doing, that I forgot myself along the way. But I'm back now... and it feels great :)",2,2020-02-03

My old pattern was to remember the sad aspects too much.
I‚Äôm the kind of person that recognises things I‚Äôm grateful for often but then during a difficult day or hour, it‚Äôs all too easy to push my feelings of great fullness to the back of my mind. Therefore the negative thoughts take over.

Do read all the pages before starting to write the diary. They are incredibly helpful to understand why you should write and ideas of what will be helpful to write.

Certainly took me longer than 3mins for the morning routine in the beginning which slightly hinders habit formation. I got there in the end and everyone will find what works for them from using this journal and tutorial bit at the start. Enjoy! X",0,2020-01-16

Similarly to reflect in the evening brings everything together.

6471,"The 6-Minute Diary Pure | Gratitude Journal, Mindfulness Journal for Men & Women | 6 Minutes a Day for more Mental Health, Happiness & Self Care",4.6,6727,nan,It REALLY is just Six Minutes,Mrs. N. E. Vaughan,5.0,United Kingdom,Colour Name: GreySize Name: English,Verified Purchase,"I absolutely love this product.  I started with the Six Minute Diary but was rather half-hearted about it - thinking it couldn't possibly be just six minutes a day... but it arrived and I filled it in that day ... and the next day... and the next day...I loved the daily quotes/affirmations;  I loved the fact that the statements/questions are simple and straightforward and didn't make it feel like an exam or that there was a ""wrong answer"".  I just love it.So much that as I filled it in one day.. then the next... then the next... I came to the end of it.  I was delighted and disappointed all at the same time... so I immediately ordered the Six Minute Diary Plus... and am very much looking to not only continuing my morning and evening ""journalling"" (which has improved my focus on my life, my goals, what I will accept and what is unacceptable to me) and I have high hopes that ""Plus"" will allow me to continue to start and end each day in a positive, productive, pro-active mindset - which has had a massive beneficial impact on so many other aspects of my life.I'm going to end here because I know I'm beginning to sound evangelical about it... but I really can't recommend it highly enough.  Buy it and tell yourself ""I'll give it my best shot for a week""... don't look at the whole book and think I'll never get to the end... just tell yourself ""seven days"".  That's what I did... but the first seven days were followed by the second seven days.. then the third ... and the fourth... and ... on those days where I couldn't fill it in first thing (with a cup of coffee in bed) ... I missed it.  My day didn't ""start right""... and on those rare occasions where I couldn't end my day positively reflecting on all the good things that had happened... I went to sleep with my heart that little bit less content .. and I couldn't hear my soul singing the lullaby that the diary created every evening.Buy it.  Try it.  I hope, like me, you'll love it.",4,2019-12-26

Field,5.0,United Kingdom,Colour Name: GreySize Name: English,Verified Purchase,"I bought this to go with a couple of books for my children (the 5 minute diary for the eldest and the 3 minute one for the younger child)... My initial objective was to get them to be grateful for their dinner... even if it's NOT chicken nuggets... be grateful you have food, you have warmth, you have comfort, even if the dinner had REAL chicken in it, as well as mushrooms!!! ... and that seemed to work, we got over that, not entirely of course, but a lesson has been learned (somewhat) in that department...
The unexpected by product of this experience however, is that THIS book grabbed my attention... it's not 'just' a gratitude journal which you write stuff down, it's the preamble, it's the all the information up front - the bit about why you're doing it in the first place...
That's what hooked me...
And then practicing the ritual with my daughters each day.
And at first, it was clutching at the obvious; grateful for food, water, clothes, warmth
But then something started to change, unexpectedly so... I started to dig deeper and feel more positive...
My gratitude now involves; realising my self worth and what I mean to my children, recognising what we have, not what we don't, grateful for opportunities and more meaningful, deeper reflection when it comes to positive affirmations....and one of my good deeds today, was simply 'Acceptance'... and 'Acceptance with grace'...
I love this book.
I have recommended and even bought copies for friends and colleagues...
I am more positive, more energised, more determined and dare I say happier in myself... I didn't even realise I needed changing, my days had been focused on other people and things and work and jobs which needed doing, that I forgot myself along the way. But I'm back now... and it feels great :)",13,2020-01-29

Well, this was probably my best purchase for sanitising my hands. This gel is antiseptic and given it is used before conducting surgery and minor operations, I think it's effectiveness is unquestionable.

I am very thorough when washing my hands and usually rub the gel into my hands for around 3 minutes, with close attention to all areas and under the nails. However, the peace of mind afterwards is fantastic, as even though I take a sanitizer with me too, you feel ""bulletproof"" knowing this product has a residual effect for up to 6 hours!

A.,2.0,United Kingdom,,Verified Purchase,"Solid with stiff board inside and the faux leather material appears quite thick. The general construction and sewing appears very good. However the item is lacking in finesse. Velcro on small pocket not aligned, so does not hold closed. However this is academic since the  pocket is not of any use.! More important, the zip, although solid, is very rough making it-for me- unusable; it jams sometimes unless I am very careful and deliberate. It reminds me of zips from 40 years ago. There is binding next to the zip. Rather than using one piece, the manufacturers have continued with a join which is unsightly and has a black mark on it. Overall the fit is tight even with a 12 cm thick A5 notebook. with a 20 mm spiral wire spine, placed inside. Personally I would have prefered if it were 5-10 mm thicker.

I am very grateful for many things in my life but I couldn‚Äôt think of enough to keep the diary interesting and repeated the same few things over and over again. Doing a good deed every day is tricky when you work alone most of the time so I had to put down daily jobs such as cooking dinner for me and my husband or walking the dogs. After about two months of repetitive writing I felt that the diary had provided me with absolutely no benefit at all. I prefer taking a walk with my dogs or spending time outdoors in my garden when the weather is good. That had a far better effect on my mind and sense of well-being. This may work for some people but I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it to anyone I know because my friends and family are quite similar to me and they wouldn‚Äôt know what to write.,6,2020-01-05

This doesn't fall under the category of diaries  - you'd be as well taking a piece of paper and writing three things you feel grateful for in the morning as that's really the only thing this offers (and you'd save yourself a heap of Money).",4,2020-02-23

Field,5.0,United Kingdom,Colour Name: GreySize Name: English,Verified Purchase,"I bought this to go with a couple of books for my children (the 5 minute diary for the eldest and the 3 minute one for the younger child)... My initial objective was to get them to be grateful for their dinner... even if it's NOT chicken nuggets... be grateful you have food, you have warmth, you have comfort, even if the dinner had REAL chicken in it, as well as mushrooms!!! ... and that seemed to work, we got over that, not entirely of course, but a lesson has been learned (somewhat) in that department...
The unexpected by product of this experience however, is that THIS book grabbed my attention... it's not 'just' a gratitude journal which you write stuff down, it's the preamble, it's the all the information up front - the bit about why you're doing it in the first place...
That's what hooked me...
And then practicing the ritual with my daughters each day.
And at first, it was clutching at the obvious; grateful for food, water, clothes, warmth
But then something started to change, unexpectedly so... I started to dig deeper and feel more positive...
My gratitude now involves; realising my self worth and what I mean to my children, recognising what we have, not what we don't, grateful for opportunities and more meaningful, deeper reflection when it comes to positive affirmations....and one of my good deeds today, was simply 'Acceptance'... and 'Acceptance with grace'...
I love this book.
I have recommended and even bought copies for friends and colleagues...
I am more positive, more energised, more determined and dare I say happier in myself... I didn't even realise I needed changing, my days had been focused on other people and things and work and jobs which needed doing, that I forgot myself along the way. But I'm back now... and it feels great :)",2,2020-02-03

This diary has already helped me. I‚Äôve used it less than a week but the timing to write.. first thing in the morning and last thing at night give perfect opportunity to start and end the day better.
My old pattern was to remember the sad aspects too much.
I‚Äôm the kind of person that recognises things I‚Äôm grateful for often but then during a difficult day or hour, it‚Äôs all too easy to push my feelings of great fullness to the back of my mind. Therefore the negative thoughts take over.

Do read all the pages before starting to write the diary. They are incredibly helpful to understand why you should write and ideas of what will be helpful to write.

I used the first version for 6 months and have now started on the Pure edition. This takes your thinking to the next level. There are suggested guidelines, but really it's up to you to decide what you want to focus on, in terms of Gratitude in your day. In a busy world, where time is of the essence, to sit down in the morning with a cuppa and consider what/who you are greatful for is a positive way to start the day. Similarly to reflect in the evening brings everything together. I was reviewing my first journal and it brought back happy memories of the small things that made me smile, in a big life that sometimes doesn't.

The Hairbrush is nice and gentle but a bit Plasticky, the nail cutters are ok but we found that they weren‚Äôt sharp enough and actually bought a small high quality pair which is way more effective, the nose sucker is way too big for a newborn and not that great later on (we ended up buying the Braun electric one after trying various other solutions). The comb is just a comb. We haven‚Äôt used the scissors. The only thing of any use is the thermometer, you can just buy one from a pharmacy as save the money and in end we ended up getting a forehead one when our daughter was 9 months because she wouldn‚Äôt stay still long enough to check her under the arm.

18155,"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",4.7,24741,nan,Low quality,Aura,1.0,United Kingdom,,,"Awful quality, there's nothing in this set that can actually be used. I had to buy every single item separately. I'll give you a few reasons for not buying this product. 1. The nail clip blade is extremely sharp and presents some irregularities. I've tried to cut my newborn nails and just by touching it cut my baby's skin, haven't even pressed on it. Checking it on with my finger I have realised it's too sharp. 2. Baby brush and comb... seriously? Those are not suitable for delicate baby skin, the bristles are too strong. 3. Digital thermometer - that should be posed under baby's arm or mouth to give the temperature... that's a joke. First of all, baby is wriggling too much and it's impossible to keep the thermometer in position under arm for around 1 minute. Secondly, you can't make the baby keep the mouth shut for a better temperature measurement... otherwise, I've tested on my own mouth and was giving a result of 34deg Celsius which is impossible. 4. Nose cleaner - there are better products out there that can actually do the job. 5. Nail file - single use. 6. Teeth brush for newborn and baby? The brush has plastic bristles which are not suitable for baby that can chew and swallow. Unfortunately, I cannot return it as I bought this product long time in advance before the baby was born. But please make yourself a favour and avoid buying this.",0,2019-12-18

Well, this was probably my best purchase for sanitising my hands. This gel is antiseptic and given it is used before conducting surgery and minor operations, I think it's effectiveness is unquestionable.

I am very thorough when washing my hands and usually rub the gel into my hands for around 3 minutes, with close attention to all areas and under the nails. However, the peace of mind afterwards is fantastic, as even though I take a sanitizer with me too, you feel ""bulletproof"" knowing this product has a residual effect for up to 6 hours!

My gums, lips and tongue always feel raw after using this and it often results in skin peeling off my inner lip.

It leaves my teeth clean and breath fresh but the side effects are not worth it. It may be as it has alcohol in it which is contributing to the dry mouth. I don't have a sensitive mouth or teeth so I am attributing this to the mouthwash.

I haven't experienced whitening at all since use.

I've now used the Reflect version of this cushion in my office for over 3-years for around 9 hours every weekday.

I'm at the upper end of the suggested weight limit, which is maybe why the cushion has now lost some of its bounce. So, I've just replaced it with a new one. It's an expensive outlay, but working out its cost per year I think its a good investment.

Apart from the reduced support/bounce, the old one has worn really well with no sign of tears or stitching coming apart.",4,2020-02-28

It feels like excellent quality and is definitely a must if you are scatterbrained like me.  The planner came with a book mark and some stickers too, which I love! The one downside for me is I would like if the boxes were a little bigger as I like to plan EVERYTHING! lol but at the same time the ability to write lists down the side is fairly handy and it means that it is more compact so it fits perfectly in my handbag.  I am unsure if it comes in a bigger size but if so I may go for that one next year, either way I will be purchasing again!!All in all I really love this planner and am excited to get to use it throughout the year to help me stay more organised!I would recommend it!:)",6,2019-12-08

I didn't want my eyes to get worse.
So I researched and came across this product.

I have been taking it for about 6 months now.

I won't be seeing my eye specialist for another 6 months, so I will find out then what difference there is in my sight and eye tests by taking these for a year will have made.

However, in the meantime I have definitely noticed a few things:

1. I have had very dry eyes for a few decades now. I have Sjogrens Syndrome. Even eyedrops didn't work well, no matter how many I used, or what make I used. These capsules have improved my dry eyes a lot, to the extent that I can feel the benefit now when I use eyedrops. I still have dry eyes, but they are made comfortable now with eyedrops. Before taking these capsules my eyes were agonisingly dry and stuck together at night and felt like sandpaper rubbing together. But those horrible sensations have now gone. This is after 6 months of taking these capsules.

2. I was having difficulty with driving this time of year when the early morning and later afternoon sun is low in the sky. This sun blinded me. In the end I avoided those times of day this time of year.
Not any more. I was driving into blinding early morning sun, for an important appointment. I was going to go a different route when I suddenly realised I wasn't being blinded by this sun. . It was still very bright with those rays, but I wasn't being blinded by it. I have been out more days with this low sun, and my eyes are fine with it now.

3. Another thing, my night time vision has improved as well. I had stopped driving at night. But I found myself driving back, the other day, in the dark because everything over ran. Then I realised the oncoming headlights were not blinding me any more.

4. I also had found tunnels hard to drive through because I couldn't see well in them. So I would take a very long route to avoid river tunnels. But I found myself driving through a tunnel because I couldn't face the long route that day. Suddenly I realised (it was the same tunnel as previously), that the light didn't seem dim any more. Also in my back garden (I watch the stars in the night sky), I found that I could see in the dark much better.

So with taking these eye capsules for the last 6 months, I have noticed an improvement in the 4 things above.

I will continue to take these capsules always.

If, after research you decide these capsules could help, then I would say give them a go. It has taken me 6 months taking them daily that has got me to this point of improvement.

When I see my eye specialist next, I will come back and report what my eye specialist says. He said that some things would get worse in my eyes, that it was a natural progression. I am hoping that in 6 months time that my eyes will be no worse than when he tested them 6 months ago. That is my hope.

*****

UPDATE August 2021
I said I would come back when I had seen the specialist again. But Covid-19 and lockdowns got in the way, and the eye hospital was not seeing patients.

I continued taking these capsules and recently I saw my hospital eye specialist again (they were seeing patients again). My eyes are continuing to do well. They are not getting worse like the specialist said they would. My specialist is pleased with my progress.

I am very pleased with these capsules.

Also because of Covid-19 and the lockdown, the NHS retinopathy team in Wales were not monitoring patients. I should have had their eye checks because of my diabetes but they were not doing them. However, recently, just before my hospital eye appointment my opticians offered a similar test to check my eyes. I decided to pay for it. My optician showed me the results, and he said to carry on whatever I was doing because it was working for my eyes. My eyes were improved and I had stopped the natural progression my hospital specialist said was inevitable.

I shall continue with these capsules.

Thank you

For example, the nasal aspirator was ineffective, and we have had to replace it, and the thermometer gives inaccurate readings, stuck at around 35.4 (which is hypothermic for a baby).

35104,"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",4.7,24730,nan,Low quality,Aura,1.0,United Kingdom,,,"Awful quality, there's nothing in this set that can actually be used. I had to buy every single item separately. I'll give you a few reasons for not buying this product. 1. The nail clip blade is extremely sharp and presents some irregularities. I've tried to cut my newborn nails and just by touching it cut my baby's skin, haven't even pressed on it. Checking it on with my finger I have realised it's too sharp. 2. Baby brush and comb... seriously? Those are not suitable for delicate baby skin, the bristles are too strong. 3. Digital thermometer - that should be posed under baby's arm or mouth to give the temperature... that's a joke. First of all, baby is wriggling too much and it's impossible to keep the thermometer in position under arm for around 1 minute. Secondly, you can't make the baby keep the mouth shut for a better temperature measurement... otherwise, I've tested on my own mouth and was giving a result of 34deg Celsius which is impossible. 4. Nose cleaner - there are better products out there that can actually do the job. 5. Nail file - single use. 6. Teeth brush for newborn and baby? The brush has plastic bristles which are not suitable for baby that can chew and swallow. Unfortunately, I cannot return it as I bought this product long time in advance before the baby was born. But please make yourself a favour and avoid buying this.",0,2019-12-18

Field,5.0,United Kingdom,Colour Name: GreySize Name: English,Verified Purchase,"I bought this to go with a couple of books for my children (the 5 minute diary for the eldest and the 3 minute one for the younger child)... My initial objective was to get them to be grateful for their dinner... even if it's NOT chicken nuggets... be grateful you have food, you have warmth, you have comfort, even if the dinner had REAL chicken in it, as well as mushrooms!!! ... and that seemed to work, we got over that, not entirely of course, but a lesson has been learned (somewhat) in that department...
The unexpected by product of this experience however, is that THIS book grabbed my attention... it's not 'just' a gratitude journal which you write stuff down, it's the preamble, it's the all the information up front - the bit about why you're doing it in the first place...
That's what hooked me...
And then practicing the ritual with my daughters each day.
And at first, it was clutching at the obvious; grateful for food, water, clothes, warmth
But then something started to change, unexpectedly so... I started to dig deeper and feel more positive...
My gratitude now involves; realising my self worth and what I mean to my children, recognising what we have, not what we don't, grateful for opportunities and more meaningful, deeper reflection when it comes to positive affirmations....and one of my good deeds today, was simply 'Acceptance'... and 'Acceptance with grace'...
I love this book.
I have recommended and even bought copies for friends and colleagues...
I am more positive, more energised, more determined and dare I say happier in myself... I didn't even realise I needed changing, my days had been focused on other people and things and work and jobs which needed doing, that I forgot myself along the way. But I'm back now... and it feels great :)",13,2020-01-29

E. Vaughan,5.0,United Kingdom,Colour Name: GreySize Name: English,Verified Purchase,"I absolutely love this product.  I started with the Six Minute Diary but was rather half-hearted about it - thinking it couldn't possibly be just six minutes a day... but it arrived and I filled it in that day ... and the next day... and the next day...I loved the daily quotes/affirmations;  I loved the fact that the statements/questions are simple and straightforward and didn't make it feel like an exam or that there was a ""wrong answer"".  I just love it.So much that as I filled it in one day.. then the next... then the next... I came to the end of it.  I was delighted and disappointed all at the same time... so I immediately ordered the Six Minute Diary Plus... and am very much looking to not only continuing my morning and evening ""journalling"" (which has improved my focus on my life, my goals, what I will accept and what is unacceptable to me) and I have high hopes that ""Plus"" will allow me to continue to start and end each day in a positive, productive, pro-active mindset - which has had a massive beneficial impact on so many other aspects of my life.I'm going to end here because I know I'm beginning to sound evangelical about it... but I really can't recommend it highly enough.  Buy it and tell yourself ""I'll give it my best shot for a week""... don't look at the whole book and think I'll never get to the end... just tell yourself ""seven days"".  That's what I did... but the first seven days were followed by the second seven days.. then the third ... and the fourth... and ... on those days where I couldn't fill it in first thing (with a cup of coffee in bed) ... I missed it.  My day didn't ""start right""... and on those rare occasions where I couldn't end my day positively reflecting on all the good things that had happened... I went to sleep with my heart that little bit less content .. and I couldn't hear my soul singing the lullaby that the diary created every evening.Buy it.  Try it.  I hope, like me, you'll love it.",4,2019-12-26

Well, this was probably my best purchase for sanitising my hands. This gel is antiseptic and given it is used before conducting surgery and minor operations, I think it's effectiveness is unquestionable.

I am very thorough when washing my hands and usually rub the gel into my hands for around 3 minutes, with close attention to all areas and under the nails. However, the peace of mind afterwards is fantastic, as even though I take a sanitizer with me too, you feel ""bulletproof"" knowing this product has a residual effect for up to 6 hours!

Well, this was probably my best purchase for sanitising my hands. This gel is antiseptic and given it is used before conducting surgery and minor operations, I think it's effectiveness is unquestionable.

I am very thorough when washing my hands and usually rub the gel into my hands for around 3 minutes, with close attention to all areas and under the nails. However, the peace of mind afterwards is fantastic, as even though I take a sanitizer with me too, you feel ""bulletproof"" knowing this product has a residual effect for up to 6 hours!

The smell is pleasant and I have not had any allergic reaction despite having sensitive skin. However, this handwash is not cheap but you get what you pay for, so the peace of mind is worth every penny!!!",4,2020-03-26

My gums, lips and tongue always feel raw after using this and it often results in skin peeling off my inner lip.

It leaves my teeth clean and breath fresh but the side effects are not worth it. It may be as it has alcohol in it which is contributing to the dry mouth. I don't have a sensitive mouth or teeth so I am attributing this to the mouthwash.

I haven't experienced whitening at all since use.

Its definitely worth it! Very pleased,stuart miller,5.0,United Kingdom,,Verified Purchase,"My Boy has terrible malassezia issues in his ears and feet (standard Tibetan Terrier issues) and would spend all day licking his feet, I've been using malaseb shampoo which is a ball ache to use as Archie hates the shower and having to shower him multiple times a week is a nightmare,I'm a veterinary Nurse and thankfully a colleague of mine recommended Leucillin as she had met the team at VetFest, I contacted leucilling directly through my practice and asked if it might help with malassezia problems and they wrote a very informative email back,In short it's fantastic, so easy to use I sprayed Archie's feet 3 times a day for about a week and now I spray maybe once every three days and the yeast cleared up perfectly and I can genuinely say Archie never licks his paws now!the fact you can spray on and leave is the best part I find, I genuinely couldn't say if the formula is that effective (seems to me like a clever dose of salt and chlorine is literally all it is) compared to a vet prescribed product like Malaseb, but the ease of use means I can do.it more often and that has made it more effective and I will certainly continue to use and buy it!

Also updated bottle is great!,Amazon Customer,5.0,United Kingdom,,Verified Purchase,I used this on my cats Hotspot when she had a flea bite reaction and she started itching the skin and fur off her tail. It was really bad but the spray did help! Now however she is averse to spray bottles so thought she was being reprimanded and purposefully irritated so she became rather depressed. Also after using this on my blisters IT STUNG LIKE HELL! so I don't know maybe it actually hurts alot! And Though her skin infection healed she would still lick at it before it could fully recover. I then switched to HomeoPet Hotspot medicine and put it in her meals for two months straight and the skin and fur returned and she's been well ever since. The spray works well and is good for human and pet emergencies but becareful if your pet might be afraid. Also after she was depressed a Kong kickaroo and thrive cat treats cheered her up!,1,2020-01-25

I don't think bullet journals are for me personally as the dots make me a bit dizzy. I thought I'd give it a go though to make more feel more organised but after 2 months I've found I'm writing more in my annual diary & on my iphone notes. Have skipped most of February already.

It's not too big or too small.The only thing bad about it, which tbh is more bad about me lol, is room for human error, I wanted the A5 and not the smaller version, the A5 seems to be only undated in rose gold, and if you're like me and prone to making mistakes, you spend time filling in the days and dates and then get them wrong and having to make ugly scribbles to correct them and not want to use it anymore",5,2020-01-07

The fact it isn‚Äôt bulky is perfect. The only things that you need to consider are it takes ages to write all the dates in and the calendar starts on Sunday and the diary part on Monday.

50635,"The 6-Minute Diary Pure | Gratitude Journal, Mindfulness Journal for Men & Women | 6 Minutes a Day for more Mental Health, Happiness & Self Care",4.6,6704,nan,From Mother of Pessimism to Mrs Optimistic!,Mrs. E. Field,5.0,United Kingdom,Colour Name: GreySize Name: English,Verified Purchase,"I bought this to go with a couple of books for my children (the 5 minute diary for the eldest and the 3 minute one for the younger child)... My initial objective was to get them to be grateful for their dinner... even if it's NOT chicken nuggets... be grateful you have food, you have warmth, you have comfort, even if the dinner had REAL chicken in it, as well as mushrooms!!! ... and that seemed to work, we got over that, not entirely of course, but a lesson has been learned (somewhat) in that department...
The unexpected by product of this experience however, is that THIS book grabbed my attention... it's not 'just' a gratitude journal which you write stuff down, it's the preamble, it's the all the information up front - the bit about why you're doing it in the first place...
That's what hooked me...
And then practicing the ritual with my daughters each day.
And at first, it was clutching at the obvious; grateful for food, water, clothes, warmth
But then something started to change, unexpectedly so... I started to dig deeper and feel more positive...
My gratitude now involves; realising my self worth and what I mean to my children, recognising what we have, not what we don't, grateful for opportunities and more meaningful, deeper reflection when it comes to positive affirmations....and one of my good deeds today, was simply 'Acceptance'... and 'Acceptance with grace'...
I love this book.
I have recommended and even bought copies for friends and colleagues...
I am more positive, more energised, more determined and dare I say happier in myself... I didn't even realise I needed changing, my days had been focused on other people and things and work and jobs which needed doing, that I forgot myself along the way. But I'm back now... and it feels great :)",13,2020-01-29

E. Vaughan,5.0,United Kingdom,Colour Name: GreySize Name: English,Verified Purchase,"I absolutely love this product.  I started with the Six Minute Diary but was rather half-hearted about it - thinking it couldn't possibly be just six minutes a day... but it arrived and I filled it in that day ... and the next day... and the next day...I loved the daily quotes/affirmations;  I loved the fact that the statements/questions are simple and straightforward and didn't make it feel like an exam or that there was a ""wrong answer"".  I just love it.So much that as I filled it in one day.. then the next... then the next... I came to the end of it.  I was delighted and disappointed all at the same time... so I immediately ordered the Six Minute Diary Plus... and am very much looking to not only continuing my morning and evening ""journalling"" (which has improved my focus on my life, my goals, what I will accept and what is unacceptable to me) and I have high hopes that ""Plus"" will allow me to continue to start and end each day in a positive, productive, pro-active mindset - which has had a massive beneficial impact on so many other aspects of my life.I'm going to end here because I know I'm beginning to sound evangelical about it... but I really can't recommend it highly enough.  Buy it and tell yourself ""I'll give it my best shot for a week""... don't look at the whole book and think I'll never get to the end... just tell yourself ""seven days"".  That's what I did... but the first seven days were followed by the second seven days.. then the third ... and the fourth... and ... on those days where I couldn't fill it in first thing (with a cup of coffee in bed) ... I missed it.  My day didn't ""start right""... and on those rare occasions where I couldn't end my day positively reflecting on all the good things that had happened... I went to sleep with my heart that little bit less content .. and I couldn't hear my soul singing the lullaby that the diary created every evening.Buy it.  Try it.  I hope, like me, you'll love it.",4,2019-12-26

Well, this was probably my best purchase for sanitising my hands.

I am very thorough when washing my hands and usually rub the gel into my hands for around 3 minutes, with close attention to all areas and under the nails.

Everything is fine but I wouldn‚Äôt buy again or reccomended to other parents. The Hairbrush is nice and gentle but a bit Plasticky, the nail cutters are ok but we found that they weren‚Äôt sharp enough and actually bought a small high quality pair which is way more effective, the nose sucker is way too big for a newborn and not that great later on (we ended up buying the Braun electric one after trying various other solutions). The comb is just a comb. We haven‚Äôt used the scissors. The only thing of any use is the thermometer, you can just buy one from a pharmacy as save the money and in end we ended up getting a forehead one when our daughter was 9 months because she wouldn‚Äôt stay still long enough to check her under the arm.

57492,"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",4.7,24713,nan,Low quality,Aura,1.0,United Kingdom,,,"Awful quality, there's nothing in this set that can actually be used. I had to buy every single item separately. I'll give you a few reasons for not buying this product. 1. The nail clip blade is extremely sharp and presents some irregularities. I've tried to cut my newborn nails and just by touching it cut my baby's skin, haven't even pressed on it. Checking it on with my finger I have realised it's too sharp. 2. Baby brush and comb... seriously? Those are not suitable for delicate baby skin, the bristles are too strong. 3. Digital thermometer - that should be posed under baby's arm or mouth to give the temperature... that's a joke. First of all, baby is wriggling too much and it's impossible to keep the thermometer in position under arm for around 1 minute. Secondly, you can't make the baby keep the mouth shut for a better temperature measurement... otherwise, I've tested on my own mouth and was giving a result of 34deg Celsius which is impossible. 4. Nose cleaner - there are better products out there that can actually do the job. 5. Nail file - single use. 6. Teeth brush for newborn and baby? The brush has plastic bristles which are not suitable for baby that can chew and swallow. Unfortunately, I cannot return it as I bought this product long time in advance before the baby was born. But please make yourself a favour and avoid buying this.",0,2019-12-18

A.,2.0,United Kingdom,,Verified Purchase,"Solid with stiff board inside and the faux leather material appears quite thick. The general construction and sewing appears very good. However the item is lacking in finesse. Velcro on small pocket not aligned, so does not hold closed. However this is academic since the  pocket is not of any use.! More important, the zip, although solid, is very rough making it-for me- unusable; it jams sometimes unless I am very careful and deliberate. It reminds me of zips from 40 years ago. There is binding next to the zip. Rather than using one piece, the manufacturers have continued with a join which is unsightly and has a black mark on it. Overall the fit is tight even with a 12 cm thick A5 notebook. with a 20 mm spiral wire spine, placed inside. Personally I would have prefered if it were 5-10 mm thicker.

I couldn‚Äôt think of anything to write without being repetitive. I had to look online for positive affirmations after I‚Äôd constantly repeated the limited few I could think up myself. I am very grateful for many things in my life but I couldn‚Äôt think of enough to keep the diary interesting and repeated the same few things over and over again. Doing a good deed every day is tricky when you work alone most of the time so I had to put down daily jobs such as cooking dinner for me and my husband or walking the dogs. After about two months of repetitive writing I felt that the diary had provided me with absolutely no benefit at all. I prefer taking a walk with my dogs or spending time outdoors in my garden when the weather is good. That had a far better effect on my mind and sense of well-being. This may work for some people but I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it to anyone I know because my friends and family are quite similar to me and they wouldn‚Äôt know what to write.,6,2020-01-05

Field,5.0,United Kingdom,Colour Name: GreySize Name: English,Verified Purchase,"I bought this to go with a couple of books for my children (the 5 minute diary for the eldest and the 3 minute one for the younger child)... My initial objective was to get them to be grateful for their dinner... even if it's NOT chicken nuggets... be grateful you have food, you have warmth, you have comfort, even if the dinner had REAL chicken in it, as well as mushrooms!!! ... and that seemed to work, we got over that, not entirely of course, but a lesson has been learned (somewhat) in that department...
The unexpected by product of this experience however, is that THIS book grabbed my attention... it's not 'just' a gratitude journal which you write stuff down, it's the preamble, it's the all the information up front - the bit about why you're doing it in the first place...
That's what hooked me...
And then practicing the ritual with my daughters each day.
And at first, it was clutching at the obvious; grateful for food, water, clothes, warmth
But then something started to change, unexpectedly so... I started to dig deeper and feel more positive...
My gratitude now involves; realising my self worth and what I mean to my children, recognising what we have, not what we don't, grateful for opportunities and more meaningful, deeper reflection when it comes to positive affirmations....and one of my good deeds today, was simply 'Acceptance'... and 'Acceptance with grace'...
I love this book.
I have recommended and even bought copies for friends and colleagues...
I am more positive, more energised, more determined and dare I say happier in myself... I didn't even realise I needed changing, my days had been focused on other people and things and work and jobs which needed doing, that I forgot myself along the way. But I'm back now... and it feels great :)",2,2020-02-03

This diary has already helped me. I‚Äôve used it less than a week but the timing to write.. first thing in the morning and last thing at night give perfect opportunity to start and end the day better.
My old pattern was to remember the sad aspects too much.
I‚Äôm the kind of person that recognises things I‚Äôm grateful for often but then during a difficult day or hour, it‚Äôs all too easy to push my feelings of great fullness to the back of my mind. Therefore the negative thoughts take over.

Do read all the pages before starting to write the diary. They are incredibly helpful to understand why you should write and ideas of what will be helpful to write.

I used the first version for 6 months and have now started on the Pure edition. This takes your thinking to the next level. There are suggested guidelines, but really it's up to you to decide what you want to focus on, in terms of Gratitude in your day. In a busy world, where time is of the essence, to sit down in the morning with a cuppa and consider what/who you are greatful for is a positive way to start the day. Similarly to reflect in the evening brings everything together. I was reviewing my first journal and it brought back happy memories of the small things that made me smile, in a big life that sometimes doesn't.

62280,"The 6-Minute Diary Pure | Gratitude Journal, Mindfulness Journal for Men & Women | 6 Minutes a Day for more Mental Health, Happiness & Self Care",4.6,6689,nan,From Mother of Pessimism to Mrs Optimistic!,Mrs. E. Field,5.0,United Kingdom,Colour Name: GreySize Name: English,Verified Purchase,"I bought this to go with a couple of books for my children (the 5 minute diary for the eldest and the 3 minute one for the younger child)... My initial objective was to get them to be grateful for their dinner... even if it's NOT chicken nuggets... be grateful you have food, you have warmth, you have comfort, even if the dinner had REAL chicken in it, as well as mushrooms!!! ... and that seemed to work, we got over that, not entirely of course, but a lesson has been learned (somewhat) in that department...
The unexpected by product of this experience however, is that THIS book grabbed my attention... it's not 'just' a gratitude journal which you write stuff down, it's the preamble, it's the all the information up front - the bit about why you're doing it in the first place...
That's what hooked me...
And then practicing the ritual with my daughters each day.
And at first, it was clutching at the obvious; grateful for food, water, clothes, warmth
But then something started to change, unexpectedly so... I started to dig deeper and feel more positive...
My gratitude now involves; realising my self worth and what I mean to my children, recognising what we have, not what we don't, grateful for opportunities and more meaningful, deeper reflection when it comes to positive affirmations....and one of my good deeds today, was simply 'Acceptance'... and 'Acceptance with grace'...
I love this book.
I have recommended and even bought copies for friends and colleagues...
I am more positive, more energised, more determined and dare I say happier in myself... I didn't even realise I needed changing, my days had been focused on other people and things and work and jobs which needed doing, that I forgot myself along the way. But I'm back now... and it feels great :)",13,2020-01-29
62286,"The 6-Minute Diary Pure | Gratitude Journal, Mindfulness Journal for Men & Women | 6 Minutes a Day for more Mental Health, Happiness & Self Care",4.6,6689,nan,It REALLY is just Six Minutes,Mrs. N. E. Vaughan,5.0,United Kingdom,Colour Name: GreySize Name: English,Verified Purchase,"I absolutely love this product.  I started with the Six Minute Diary but was rather half-hearted about it - thinking it couldn't possibly be just six minutes a day... but it arrived and I filled it in that day ... and the next day... and the next day...I loved the daily quotes/affirmations;  I loved the fact that the statements/questions are simple and straightforward and didn't make it feel like an exam or that there was a ""wrong answer"".  I just love it.So much that as I filled it in one day.. then the next... then the next... I came to the end of it.  I was delighted and disappointed all at the same time... so I immediately ordered the Six Minute Diary Plus... and am very much looking to not only continuing my morning and evening ""journalling"" (which has improved my focus on my life, my goals, what I will accept and what is unacceptable to me) and I have high hopes that ""Plus"" will allow me to continue to start and end each day in a positive, productive, pro-active mindset - which has had a massive beneficial impact on so many other aspects of my life.I'm going to end here because I know I'm beginning to sound evangelical about it... but I really can't recommend it highly enough.  Buy it and tell yourself ""I'll give it my best shot for a week""... don't look at the whole book and think I'll never get to the end... just tell yourself ""seven days"".  That's what I did... but the first seven days were followed by the second seven days.. then the third ... and the fourth... and ... on those days where I couldn't fill it in first thing (with a cup of coffee in bed) ... I missed it.  My day didn't ""start right""... and on those rare occasions where I couldn't end my day positively reflecting on all the good things that had happened... I went to sleep with my heart that little bit less content .. and I couldn't hear my soul singing the lullaby that the diary created every evening.Buy it.  Try it.  I hope, like me, you'll love it.",4,2019-12-26

Well, this was probably my best purchase for sanitising my hands. This gel is antiseptic and given it is used before conducting surgery and minor operations, I think it's effectiveness is unquestionable.

I am very thorough when washing my hands and usually rub the gel into my hands for around 3 minutes, with close attention to all areas and under the nails. However, the peace of mind afterwards is fantastic, as even though I take a sanitizer with me too, you feel ""bulletproof"" knowing this product has a residual effect for up to 6 hours!

Everything is fine but I wouldn‚Äôt buy again or reccomended to other parents. The Hairbrush is nice and gentle but a bit Plasticky, the nail cutters are ok but we found that they weren‚Äôt sharp enough and actually bought a small high quality pair which is way more effective, the nose sucker is way too big for a newborn and not that great later on (we ended up buying the Braun electric one after trying various other solutions). The comb is just a comb. We haven‚Äôt used the scissors. The only thing of any use is the thermometer, you can just buy one from a pharmacy as save the money and in end we ended up getting a forehead one when our daughter was 9 months because she wouldn‚Äôt stay still long enough to check her under the arm.

69171,"Tommee Tippee Healthcare Kit for Baby, Black, 9 Count",4.7,24691,nan,Low quality,Aura,1.0,United Kingdom,,,"Awful quality, there's nothing in this set that can actually be used. I had to buy every single item separately. I'll give you a few reasons for not buying this product. 1. The nail clip blade is extremely sharp and presents some irregularities. I've tried to cut my newborn nails and just by touching it cut my baby's skin, haven't even pressed on it. Checking it on with my finger I have realised it's too sharp. 2. Baby brush and comb... seriously? Those are not suitable for delicate baby skin, the bristles are too strong. 3. Digital thermometer - that should be posed under baby's arm or mouth to give the temperature... that's a joke. First of all, baby is wriggling too much and it's impossible to keep the thermometer in position under arm for around 1 minute. Secondly, you can't make the baby keep the mouth shut for a better temperature measurement... otherwise, I've tested on my own mouth and was giving a result of 34deg Celsius which is impossible. 4. Nose cleaner - there are better products out there that can actually do the job. 5. Nail file - single use. 6. Teeth brush for newborn and baby? The brush has plastic bristles which are not suitable for baby that can chew and swallow. Unfortunately, I cannot return it as I bought this product long time in advance before the baby was born. But please make yourself a favour and avoid buying this.",0,2019-12-18

A.,2.0,United Kingdom,,Verified Purchase,"Solid with stiff board inside and the faux leather material appears quite thick. The general construction and sewing appears very good. However the item is lacking in finesse. Velcro on small pocket not aligned, so does not hold closed. However this is academic since the  pocket is not of any use.! More important, the zip, although solid, is very rough making it-for me- unusable; it jams sometimes unless I am very careful and deliberate. It reminds me of zips from 40 years ago. There is binding next to the zip. Rather than using one piece, the manufacturers have continued with a join which is unsightly and has a black mark on it. Overall the fit is tight even with a 12 cm thick A5 notebook. with a 20 mm spiral wire spine, placed inside. Personally I would have prefered if it were 5-10 mm thicker.

Higham,5.0,United Kingdom,,Verified Purchase,"Junior still can't hold a spoon at 2.5 years, has developmental delay and sensory issues amongst other things and always big issues around food generally. For some reason he uses finger and thumb to hold cutlery /really weak fist if we're lucky and ends up turning it upside down before it reaches his mouth (again for unknown reasons!) He also won't touch most food so we end up feeding him, but given his age he's been point blank refusing as he's craving control but just can't manage it. We've tried EVERYTHING...or so we thought!

The shape of this set has just meant he has managed to stab tomatoes and strawberries, scooped omelette and yoghurt and SOME MADE IT TO HIS MOUTH rather than his lap! We did iiiiiit!!!

Also arrived in a couple of days and the colours are appealing to children. The edges are curved so risk of injury is less, but the knife actually does cut and the fork is still pointed enough to actually get through food such as tomato skins, peppers etc.

We have had such stress around mealtimes recently and it sounds dramatic but it's honestly helped a situation that was starting to make the whole family miserable and dread mealtimes. Thank you so much!",3,2020-02-16

I couldn‚Äôt think of anything to write without being repetitive. I had to look online for positive affirmations after I‚Äôd constantly repeated the limited few I could think up myself. I am very grateful for many things in my life but I couldn‚Äôt think of enough to keep the diary interesting and repeated the same few things over and over again. Doing a good deed every day is tricky when you work alone most of the time so I had to put down daily jobs such as cooking dinner for me and my husband or walking the dogs. After about two months of repetitive writing I felt that the diary had provided me with absolutely no benefit at all. I prefer taking a walk with my dogs or spending time outdoors in my garden when the weather is good. That had a far better effect on my mind and sense of well-being. This may work for some people but I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it to anyone I know because my friends and family are quite similar to me and they wouldn‚Äôt know what to write.,6,2020-01-05

Field,5.0,United Kingdom,Colour Name: GreySize Name: English,Verified Purchase,"I bought this to go with a couple of books for my children (the 5 minute diary for the eldest and the 3 minute one for the younger child)... My initial objective was to get them to be grateful for their dinner... even if it's NOT chicken nuggets... be grateful you have food, you have warmth, you have comfort, even if the dinner had REAL chicken in it, as well as mushrooms!!! ... and that seemed to work, we got over that, not entirely of course, but a lesson has been learned (somewhat) in that department...
The unexpected by product of this experience however, is that THIS book grabbed my attention... it's not 'just' a gratitude journal which you write stuff down, it's the preamble, it's the all the information up front - the bit about why you're doing it in the first place...
That's what hooked me...
And then practicing the ritual with my daughters each day.
And at first, it was clutching at the obvious; grateful for food, water, clothes, warmth
But then something started to change, unexpectedly so... I started to dig deeper and feel more positive...
My gratitude now involves; realising my self worth and what I mean to my children, recognising what we have, not what we don't, grateful for opportunities and more meaningful, deeper reflection when it comes to positive affirmations....and one of my good deeds today, was simply 'Acceptance'... and 'Acceptance with grace'...
I love this book.
I have recommended and even bought copies for friends and colleagues...
I am more positive, more energised, more determined and dare I say happier in myself... I didn't even realise I needed changing, my days had been focused on other people and things and work and jobs which needed doing, that I forgot myself along the way. But I'm back now... and it feels great :)",2,2020-02-03

This has helped a lot but often the negative thoughts far outweigh the good.

This diary has already helped me. I‚Äôve used it less than a week but the timing to write.. first thing in the morning and last thing at night give perfect opportunity to start and end the day better.
My old pattern was to remember the sad aspects too much.
I‚Äôm the kind of person that recognises things I‚Äôm grateful for often but then during a difficult day or hour, it‚Äôs all too easy to push my feelings of great fullness to the back of my mind. Therefore the negative thoughts take over.

Do read all the pages before starting to write the diary. They are incredibly helpful to understand why you should write and ideas of what will be helpful to write.

Certainly took me longer than 3mins for the morning routine in the beginning which slightly hinders habit formation.

I used the first version for 6 months and have now started on the Pure edition. This takes your thinking to the next level. There are suggested guidelines, but really it's up to you to decide what you want to focus on, in terms of Gratitude in your day. In a busy world, where time is of the essence, to sit down in the morning with a cuppa and consider what/who you are greatful for is a positive way to start the day. Similarly to reflect in the evening brings everything together. I was reviewing my first journal and it brought back happy memories of the small things that made me smile, in a big life that sometimes doesn't.

My gums, lips and tongue always feel raw after using this and it often results in skin peeling off my inner lip.

It leaves my teeth clean and breath fresh but the side effects are not worth it. It may be as it has alcohol in it which is contributing to the dry mouth. I don't have a sensitive mouth or teeth so I am attributing this to the mouthwash.

I haven't experienced whitening at all since use.

I didn't want my eyes to get worse.
So I researched and came across this product.

I have been taking it for about 6 months now.

I won't be seeing my eye specialist for another 6 months, so I will find out then what difference there is in my sight and eye tests by taking these for a year will have made.

However, in the meantime I have definitely noticed a few things:

1. I have had very dry eyes for a few decades now. I have Sjogrens Syndrome. Even eyedrops didn't work well, no matter how many I used, or what make I used. These capsules have improved my dry eyes a lot, to the extent that I can feel the benefit now when I use eyedrops. I still have dry eyes, but they are made comfortable now with eyedrops. Before taking these capsules my eyes were agonisingly dry and stuck together at night and felt like sandpaper rubbing together. But those horrible sensations have now gone. This is after 6 months of taking these capsules.

2. I was having difficulty with driving this time of year when the early morning and later afternoon sun is low in the sky. This sun blinded me. In the end I avoided those times of day this time of year.
Not any more. I was driving into blinding early morning sun, for an important appointment. I was going to go a different route when I suddenly realised I wasn't being blinded by this sun. . It was still very bright with those rays, but I wasn't being blinded by it. I have been out more days with this low sun, and my eyes are fine with it now.

3. Another thing, my night time vision has improved as well. I had stopped driving at night. But I found myself driving back, the other day, in the dark because everything over ran. Then I realised the oncoming headlights were not blinding me any more.

4. I also had found tunnels hard to drive through because I couldn't see well in them. So I would take a very long route to avoid river tunnels. But I found myself driving through a tunnel because I couldn't face the long route that day. Suddenly I realised (it was the same tunnel as previously), that the light didn't seem dim any more. Also in my back garden (I watch the stars in the night sky), I found that I could see in the dark much better.

So with taking these eye capsules for the last 6 months, I have noticed an improvement in the 4 things above.

I will continue to take these capsules always.

If, after research you decide these capsules could help, then I would say give them a go. It has taken me 6 months taking them daily that has got me to this point of improvement.

When I see my eye specialist next, I will come back and report what my eye specialist says. He said that some things would get worse in my eyes, that it was a natural progression. I am hoping that in 6 months time that my eyes will be no worse than when he tested them 6 months ago. That is my hope.

*****

UPDATE August 2021
I said I would come back when I had seen the specialist again. But Covid-19 and lockdowns got in the way, and the eye hospital was not seeing patients.

I continued taking these capsules and recently I saw my hospital eye specialist again (they were seeing patients again). My eyes are continuing to do well. They are not getting worse like the specialist said they would. My specialist is pleased with my progress.

I am very pleased with these capsules.

Also because of Covid-19 and the lockdown, the NHS retinopathy team in Wales were not monitoring patients. I should have had their eye checks because of my diabetes but they were not doing them. However, recently, just before my hospital eye appointment my opticians offered a similar test to check my eyes. I decided to pay for it. My optician showed me the results, and he said to carry on whatever I was doing because it was working for my eyes. My eyes were improved and I had stopped the natural progression my hospital specialist said was inevitable.

I shall continue with these capsules.

Thank you

Its definitely worth it! Very pleased,stuart miller,5.0,United Kingdom,,Verified Purchase,"My Boy has terrible malassezia issues in his ears and feet (standard Tibetan Terrier issues) and would spend all day licking his feet, I've been using malaseb shampoo which is a ball ache to use as Archie hates the shower and having to shower him multiple times a week is a nightmare,I'm a veterinary Nurse and thankfully a colleague of mine recommended Leucillin as she had met the team at VetFest, I contacted leucilling directly through my practice and asked if it might help with malassezia problems and they wrote a very informative email back,In short it's fantastic, so easy to use I sprayed Archie's feet 3 times a day for about a week and now I spray maybe once every three days and the yeast cleared up perfectly and I can genuinely say Archie never licks his paws now!the fact you can spray on and leave is the best part I find, I genuinely couldn't say if the formula is that effective (seems to me like a clever dose of salt and chlorine is literally all it is) compared to a vet prescribed product like Malaseb, but the ease of use means I can do.it more often and that has made it more effective and I will certainly continue to use and buy it! High recommend",10,2020-03-13

Also updated bottle is great!,Amazon Customer,5.0,United Kingdom,,Verified Purchase,I used this on my cats Hotspot when she had a flea bite reaction and she started itching the skin and fur off her tail. It was really bad but the spray did help! Now however she is averse to spray bottles so thought she was being reprimanded and purposefully irritated so she became rather depressed. Also after using this on my blisters IT STUNG LIKE HELL! so I don't know maybe it actually hurts alot! And Though her skin infection healed she would still lick at it before it could fully recover. I then switched to HomeoPet Hotspot medicine and put it in her meals for two months straight and the skin and fur returned and she's been well ever since. The spray works well and is good for human and pet emergencies but becareful if your pet might be afraid. Also after she was depressed a Kong kickaroo and thrive cat treats cheered her up!,1,2020-01-25

80758,"The 6-Minute Diary Pure | Gratitude Journal, Mindfulness Journal for Men & Women | 6 Minutes a Day for more Mental Health, Happiness & Self Care",4.6,6690,nan,It REALLY is just Six Minutes,Mrs. N. E. Vaughan,5.0,United Kingdom,Colour Name: GreySize Name: English,Verified Purchase,"I absolutely love this product.  I started with the Six Minute Diary but was rather half-hearted about it - thinking it couldn't possibly be just six minutes a day... but it arrived and I filled it in that day ... and the next day... and the next day...I loved the daily quotes/affirmations;  I loved the fact that the statements/questions are simple and straightforward and didn't make it feel like an exam or that there was a ""wrong answer"".  I just love it.So much that as I filled it in one day.. then the next... then the next... I came to the end of it.  I was delighted and disappointed all at the same time... so I immediately ordered the Six Minute Diary Plus... and am very much looking to not only continuing my morning and evening ""journalling"" (which has improved my focus on my life, my goals, what I will accept and what is unacceptable to me) and I have high hopes that ""Plus"" will allow me to continue to start and end each day in a positive, productive, pro-active mindset - which has had a massive beneficial impact on so many other aspects of my life.I'm going to end here because I know I'm beginning to sound evangelical about it... but I really can't recommend it highly enough.  Buy it and tell yourself ""I'll give it my best shot for a week""... don't look at the whole book and think I'll never get to the end... just tell yourself ""seven days"".  That's what I did... but the first seven days were followed by the second seven days.. then the third ... and the fourth... and ... on those days where I couldn't fill it in first thing (with a cup of coffee in bed) ... I missed it.  My day didn't ""start right""... and on those rare occasions where I couldn't end my day positively reflecting on all the good things that had happened... I went to sleep with my heart that little bit less content .. and I couldn't hear my soul singing the lullaby that the diary created every evening.Buy it.  Try it.  I hope, like me, you'll love it.",4,2019-12-26
80761,"The 6-Minute Diary Pure | Gratitude Journal, Mindfulness Journal for Men & Women | 6 Minutes a Day for more Mental Health, Happiness & Self Care",4.6,6690,nan,From Mother of Pessimism to Mrs Optimistic!,Mrs. E. Field,5.0,United Kingdom,Colour Name: GreySize Name: English,Verified Purchase,"I bought this to go with a couple of books for my children (the 5 minute diary for the eldest and the 3 minute one for the younger child)... My initial objective was to get them to be grateful for their dinner... even if it's NOT chicken nuggets... be grateful you have food, you have warmth, you have comfort, even if the dinner had REAL chicken in it, as well as mushrooms!!! ... and that seemed to work, we got over that, not entirely of course, but a lesson has been learned (somewhat) in that department...
The unexpected by product of this experience however, is that THIS book grabbed my attention... it's not 'just' a gratitude journal which you write stuff down, it's the preamble, it's the all the information up front - the bit about why you're doing it in the first place...
That's what hooked me...
And then practicing the ritual with my daughters each day.
And at first, it was clutching at the obvious; grateful for food, water, clothes, warmth
But then something started to change, unexpectedly so... I started to dig deeper and feel more positive...
My gratitude now involves; realising my self worth and what I mean to my children, recognising what we have, not what we don't, grateful for opportunities and more meaningful, deeper reflection when it comes to positive affirmations....and one of my good deeds today, was simply 'Acceptance'... and 'Acceptance with grace'...
I love this book.
I have recommended and even bought copies for friends and colleagues...
I am more positive, more energised, more determined and dare I say happier in myself... I didn't even realise I needed changing, my days had been focused on other people and things and work and jobs which needed doing, that I forgot myself along the way. But I'm back now... and it feels great :)",13,2020-01-29
